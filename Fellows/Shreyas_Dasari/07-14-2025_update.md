# Bi-Weekly Update: Pokémon Battle Simulation

**Summary of Work Completed in Past Two Weeks:**<br />
- Developed and tested the full battle engine including terrain-effect modifiers, STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), and move priority logic using custom rules and PokeAPI integration.<br />
- Implemented roster selection and randomized team composition logic from a pool of 50 non-legendary Pokémon to simulate resource allocation and blind draft scenarios.<br />
- Integrated seven terrain types (Fire, Water, Grass, Rock, Electric, Psychic, Normal), with terrain-dependent move modifiers built into the damage calculation module.<br />
- Simulated best-of-five tournament rounds between LLM-based agents, built around dynamic match scheduling and elimination logic.<br />
- Created scoring pipeline that calculates agent performance based on win count, knockouts, strategic efficiency, adaptability, and resilience.<br />
- Conducted early debugging of move selection logic and fixed a type-effectiveness calculation bug where terrain boosts were not applied consistently for Electric-type moves.<br />
- Collaborated with Rishabh Madani to refine LLM agent prompting strategy and caching system to reduce redundant Groq API calls.

**Challenges Encountered and How They Were Addressed:**<br />
- Encountered an issue where Electric Terrain boosts were incorrectly applied to all moves instead of Electric-type only. Resolved by inserting type validation in the terrain-boost function.<br />
- Noticed Groq API rate-limiting during tournament simulations; addressed by implementing a simple caching mechanism for repeated roster and move selections.<br />
- Random roster generation occasionally included multiple Pokémon with duplicate move sets, which affected simulation diversity. This was patched by enforcing uniqueness constraints on final battle rosters.

**Goals for Next Two Weeks:**<br />
- Finalize implementation of LLM agent type-preference heuristics and create distinct personalities for each agent.<br />
- Expand scoring logic to include dynamic strategy-shift tracking (e.g., response to super-effective damage or opponent switching).<br />
- Add detailed logging for each turn and tournament round, including move choices, terrain effects, and damage breakdowns, to enable post-hoc agent behavior analysis.<br />
- Run multiple full tournament simulations with 8 agents and analyze performance trends across different terrain conditions.<br />
- Begin drafting data visualization functions to present scoring metrics, win rates, and team composition efficiency.

**Any Resources or Assistance Needed:**<br />
- Need input from Rishabh Madani on improving agent prompt structure for more context-aware move selection.<br />
- Guidance on formatting tournament logs into a structured JSON/CSV format for downstream statistical analysis would be helpful.<br />
- Explore feasibility of migrating simulation logs to an external database or cloud bucket (e.g., AWS S3) for large-scale experiment runs.

**Hours Contributed During This Period:**<br />
I spent **40 hours over the last two weeks** working on the Pokémon Battle Simulation project, including engine development, bug fixing, tournament logic, and AI strategy refinement.
