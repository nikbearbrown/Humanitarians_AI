### Biweekly Progress Report

Project Repo: https://github.com/Humanitariansai/Cyber-Physical-Systems

Reporting Period: July 28 - Aug 9, 2025

Student: Udisha Dutta Chowdhury

Supervisor: Prof. Rolando Herrero

### Summary of Work Completed

1. Developed and benchmarked three forecasting models: Baseline (Linear Regression), Traditional (ARIMA), and Advanced ML (XGBoost).

2. Achieved best performance with the XGBoost model (MAPE=0.2%), significantly outperforming ARIMA (0.3%) and the baseline (1.75%).

3. Key to success was extensive feature engineering for the XGBoost model, creating 33 features from time-lags, rolling stats, and date components.

### Challenges Encountered and Solutions

Challenge: Simple models failed to capture time dependencies.

Solution: Progressed from a simple baseline to time-series specific models (ARIMA) and then to a feature-rich ML model (XGBoost) for improved accuracy.

### Goals for Next Two Weeks (Aug 11 - Aug 23, 2025)

Model Optimization: Implement automated hyperparameter tuning for the XGBoost model to find the optimal parameters and further improve accuracy.

Experiment Tracking with MLOps: Set up MLflow to systematically log all experiment runs, including parameters, performance metrics, and model artifacts for reproducibility and versioning.
