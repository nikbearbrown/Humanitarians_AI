### Biweekly Progress Report

Project Repo: https://github.com/Humanitariansai/Cyber-Physical-Systems

Reporting Period: July 14 - July 25, 2025

Student: Udisha Dutta Chowdhury

Supervisor: Prof. Rolando Herrero

### Summary of Work Completed

1. Sensor Simulation System 

Implemented realistic seasonal cycles, daily variations, and weather effects for temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors.

Created 3 environment presets (office, outdoor, industrial) with distinct behavioral characteristics

Built comprehensive dataset generation with 50+ engineered features including lag variables, rolling statistics, and temporal encodings

Added sensor drift simulation, anomaly injection (spikes, drops, noise), and cross-sensor correlations for realistic behavior

Comprehensive Testing: 25+ unit tests covering functionality, integration, and performance scenarios



2. Time Series forecasting models

Learning and trying to implement a simple time series base forecaster (Work in Progress).

Trying test cases for basic time series forecaster

### Challenges Encountered and Solutions

Realistic Sensor Pattern Modeling

Issue: Creating mathematically accurate sensor patterns that mirror real-world behavior

Solution: Implemented trigonometric functions for seasonal/daily cycles, added configurable noise models, and included weather pattern simulation for pressure sensors




### Goals for Next Two Weeks (July 28- Aug 9, 2025)

Continue with creating time series forecasting models.

Develop predictive algorithms for critical system variables (temperature trends, pressure changes)

Create model training pipeline with automated hyperparameter tuning

Establish model evaluation metrics and validation frameworks
