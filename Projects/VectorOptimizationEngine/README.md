# Advancements, Clustering & Optimization Engine

**Description:**  
Modern vector databases struggle with efficiency and accuracy when handling large-scale, noisy datasets. This module aims to solve this by introducing **auto-clustering**, **dynamic cluster lifecycle management**, and **multi-modal data support** (images, CSVs, tables, texts). The engine will automatically organize data into hierarchical clusters, refine them, and optimize storage for similarity search. Designed for use cases like medical data organization (e.g., cancer treatment subtyping), this module will integrate with Ollama for embedding generation and leverage advanced clustering algorithms.

### Assumptions:
This module will have access to the highest quality Chunks from the Contextual chunking engine.

### Key Features and Requirements:

#### **1. Multi-Modal Data Support:**
   - **Input Types:** Images, CSVs, tables, and text.
   - **Processing:**
     - Convert images to embeddings.
     - Process tabular data (CSVs/tables) into structured embeddings.
     - Handle text with Ollama-served embedding models (e.g., `mxbai-embed-large`).
   - **Output:** Unified vector representations stored in a vector database (ChromaDB and Milvus).

#### **2. Auto-Clustering & Sub-Clustering:**
   - **Dynamic Clustering:**
     - Group similar vectors into clusters using algorithms like HDBSCAN or OPTICS.
     - Automatically tag clusters (e.g., "Brain Cancer - MRI Scans").
   - **Sub-Cluster Creation:**
     - Enable hierarchical clustering (e.g., "Brain Cancer → Glioblastoma → Patient Cohort A").
     - Recursively apply clustering to create sub-clusters within parent clusters.
   - **Granular Refinement:**
     - Detect and remove false positives using outlier detection.
     - Allow manual/automated splitting of overly broad clusters.

#### **3. Cluster Lifecycle Management:**
   - **Merging/Splitting:**
     - Merge clusters if overlap exceeds a threshold (e.g., Jaccard similarity > 80%).
     - Split clusters based on intra-cluster variance or user-defined rules (avail user config).
   - **Cluster Tagging:**
     - Auto-generate tags using LLMs (via Ollama) for semantic descriptions.
     - Example: Cluster "Brain_Cancer_Subtype_12" → Tag "Aggressive Glioblastoma in Patients Aged 40-60".
     You may maintain a knowledge Graph to maintain and establish relationships between clusters. 

#### **4. Optimization Engine:**
   - **Storage Efficiency:**
     - Compress redundant vectors within clusters.
     - Prune low-impact vectors to reduce noise.
   - **Query Acceleration:**
     - Index clusters for faster similarity search.
     - Prioritize high-density clusters during retrieval.

#### **5. Integration with Ollama:**
   - Use Ollama to serve:
     - Embedding models (text/tabular data).
     - Vision-language models (image-to-embedding conversion).
     - LLMs for cluster tagging and metadata generation.

### Implementation Guidelines:

1. **Modular Components:**
   - **Data Processor:** Handles multi-modal data conversion to embeddings.
   - **Clustering Engine:** Manages dynamic clustering and sub-clustering.
   - **Lifecycle Manager:** Handles merging/splitting and optimization.
   - **Tagging Module:** Generates semantic cluster tags using Ollama.

2. **Hierarchical Clustering Workflow:**
   - Convert raw data (images, tables, text) to embeddings.
   - Perform primary clustering (e.g., "Cancer Types").
   - Recursively apply clustering to create sub-clusters (e.g., "Brain Cancer → Subtypes").
   - Store cluster hierarchy in Neo4j for relationship tracking.

3. **Technical Stack:**
   - **Vector Storage:** FAISS or Annoy for efficient similarity search.
   - **Metadata Storage:** Chroma DB for cluster tags and embeddings.
   - **Graph Database:** Neo4j for cluster hierarchy and relationships.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Retry failed Ollama API calls for embedding/tag generation.
   - Validate cluster stability (e.g., prevent over-fragmentation).

5. **Use Case Example (Medical):**
   - **Input:** 10,000 MRI scans (images), patient CSV data (age, treatment history).
   - **Processing:**
     - Convert MRIs to embeddings via Ollama VLM.
     - Cluster images into "Brain Cancer" and sub-clusters by subtype.
     - Merge overlapping clusters (e.g., "Grade III/IV Gliomas").
   - **Output:** Hierarchical clusters tagged as "Pediatric Brain Tumors," "Adult Glioblastoma," etc.
   Create a retrieval strategy on the vector database abstractions. Dataset will be provided.
