    Ensemble learning methods have become cornerstone techniques in machine learning due to their ability to combine weak learners into robust predictive models. This report examines the mathematical foundations of seven key algorithms: **Random Forest**, **Extra Trees**, **AdaBoost**, **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**, **LightGBM**, **XGBoost**, and **CatBoost**. Each algorithm introduces unique innovations in tree construction, loss function optimization, and feature handling, leading to distinct performance characteristics in accuracy, computational efficiency, and overfitting resistance.
