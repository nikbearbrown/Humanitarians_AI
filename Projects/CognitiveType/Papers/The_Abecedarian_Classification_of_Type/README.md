# The Abecedarian Classification of Type 


**Abstract**

This paper introduces "Abecedarian Axes of Variation" a novel type
classification system designed to harmonize multiple established
typographic classification systems into a unified framework for the
training of deep learning models. By integrating the distinctive
attributes and methodologies of the Panose 1 Classification, Vox ATypI
Classification, IBM's Classification of Fonts, The Alessandrini
Classification of Typefaces: Codex 80, The British Standards
Classification of Typefaces (BS 2961), DIN 16518, and Bringhurst's
System, we focused solely on terms that represent "Axes of Variation."
Axes of Variation are physical characteristics such as weight, width,
optical size, sans serif, slant, or italic. Furthermore, these Axes of
Variation also refer to typographic terms that typographers use to
describe type, like Humanist, Grotesque, Geometric, etc. We also
extracted all Axes of Variation in Variable Fonts OpenType specification
(OpenType 1.8) and the names of typefaces from every Wikipedia page that
characterizes itself as a typeface. This would allow of a “Text to Type”
foundation model to understand prompts like “ Create a typeface like
Garamond but with low stroke contrast and square terminals.”

This Axes of Variation approach aims to create a comprehensive, multi
dimensional approach to type classification, especially for the training
of "Text to Type" foundation models. This integration addresses the
complexities and varied dimensions of typographic glyphs, providing a
detailed, nuanced categorization scheme that captures the essence of
type design across historical and stylistic spectrums.

The primary objective of Abecedarian is to generate a rich, labeled
dataset that serves as a foundational base for training advanced text to
type foundation models. By meticulously labeling typographic glyphs with
multi faceted classification metadata, the Abecedarian Axes of Variation
facilitates the creation of machine learning models capable of
understanding and generating typefaces with unprecedented accuracy and
specificity. This system not only promises to revolutionize the way
designers interact with type libraries, enabling more intuitive and
precise searches but also opens new avenues for the automated design of
typefaces that resonate with historical typographic principles while
catering to contemporary aesthetic demands.

In developing Abecedarian, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of each
contributing classification system, focusing on Axes of Variation,
identifying core attributes, and unique classification criteria. This
synthesis led to the establishment of a meta classification scheme that
leverages the strengths of individual systems while mitigating their
limitations. Our methodology involved both qualitative and quantitative
analyses to ensure that the resulting classification system is robust,
scalable, and adaptable to the evolving landscape of typography.

This paper details the Abecedarian Axes of Variation, from
conceptualization to implementation, and discusses its potential
implications for the fields of typography, design, and artificial
intelligence. Through Abecedarian, we envision a future where the gap
between textual content and its typographic presentation narrows,
facilitated by intelligent systems that understand the nuanced language
of typefaces as deeply as human designers do.

**Introduction**

Reading is a fundamental tool for acquiring knowledge and learning. The
configuration of letters and the design principles behind typography are
pivotal in enhancing the legibility of text, presenting information
clearly, and ensuring a smooth reading experience. Studies have shown
the significant impact of typography on factors including legibility,
comprehension, and visual appeal (Beier et al., 2013, 2017; Bessemans,
2016a, 2016b; Bigelow, 2019; Brath and Banissi, 2016; Dressler, 2019;
French et al., 2013; Gasser et al., 2005; Kanfer and Ackerman, 1989;
Larson et al., 2006; Larson and Picard, 2005; Lewis and Walker, 1989;
Oppenheimer and Frank, 2008; Price et al., 2016; Pušnik et al., 2016;
Wilkins et al., 2009; Woods et al., 2005). These investigations
underscore the fact that different fonts not only influence reading ease
but also significantly impact the retention and processing of
information. For instance, serif fonts have been recognized for their
ability to enhance memory recall compared to sans serif fonts,
underscoring the critical role font selection plays in readability and
understanding. Despite the seemingly arbitrary nature of choosing fonts,
it's evident that various typefaces lead to different cognitive effects,
with some improving readability and visual attractiveness more than
others.

Nonetheless, the direct impact of specific visual characteristics of
typefaces, such as serif styles or x heights, on readability and visual
quality remains underexplored. This highlights an ongoing need for
research aimed at understanding how typography can better the reading
experience and bolster information retention. The recurring evidence
that serif fonts generally promote better information recall than sans
serif fonts points to the significant influence of font choice on
readability and comprehension. While selecting fonts might appear to be
a matter of personal preference, it's clear that certain typefaces
result in more favorable cognitive outcomes, enhancing both readability
and the aesthetic quality of text. This recognition of the importance of
font characteristics calls for further studies to delve into how
specific aspects of typography can optimize reading experiences and aid
in the effective communication of vital information.

**The Anatomy of Type**

The Latin alphabet, like every alphabet, showcases remarkable diversity
in shapes and proportions. This variety arises from different sources:
unique historical evolutions, linguistic or cultural differences, or the
tools used in lettering, such as pens, chisels, or compasses. Part of
this variability also comes from typographers' enthusiasm for endlessly
refining existing typefaces, driven by a blend of aesthetics and fun.

Despite this diversity, there's a consistent set of features across
letterforms that enables the creation of a standardized vocabulary to
describe them. This effort aims to define these "Axes of Variation" for
developing "Text to Type" foundation models. However, the rich history
behind the development of typographic terms has resulted in a mix of
terminology. For example, terms borrowed from human anatomy describe
many letterforms with "legs," "necks," "ears," and "feet." Other terms
may be derived from designers' names, like Garamond or Bodoni, or
historical concepts like Humanist or Grotesque. Most foundation models,
and indeed most people outside of typography, may not understand what it
means to describe a typeface as "Humanist."

Adding to the complexity, terminology often varies among designers and
writers who might use different words for the same letter part. For
clarity and consistency, this work aligns terms with synonyms and
translates typographic terms into various languages, enabling every
typographer to use them in their preferred language or style.

Delving into type anatomy, it's crucial to acknowledge that many of its
measurements are relative. This relativity is important when training
deep learning models to understand concepts such as a 'long ascender'.
An 'ascender' is the part of a lowercase letter that extends above the
main body, seen in letters like 'b' or 'd', while a 'descender' extends
below the baseline, as in 'p' or 'q'. The 'x height' represents the
height of lowercase letters without ascenders or descenders, essentially
the core height of characters like 'a', 'e', 'm', and 'n'. Other vital
features include the 'bowl', the curved part of letters such as 'd' or
'b', the 'counter', the space within the bowl, and the 'apex', where two
strokes meet.

Understanding type anatomy and its components is crucial not only for
appreciating the art of typography but also for developing "Text to
Type" foundation models. These models aim to convert textual
descriptions into precise typographic representations, requiring a deep
understanding of how different elements of type anatomy—such as
ascenders, descenders, x heights, bowls, counters, and apexes—influence
the visual and functional characteristics of typefaces.

For "Text to Type" models, a nuanced grasp of type anatomy enables the
creation of sophisticated and accurate typographic outputs. By
recognizing and quantifying the relative measures of type components,
these models can accurately interpret descriptions like 'long ascender'
or 'large x height' within the context of type design. This ability is
crucial for producing typefaces that meet specific aesthetic or
functional criteria, such as readability, legibility, or stylistic
alignment with a design ethos.

Furthermore, detailed knowledge of type anatomy allows these models to
navigate the vast typography landscape, where subtle feature differences
significantly impact design and communication effectiveness. For
instance, understanding the effects of serif styles, stroke weight
variations, or letter spacing helps the models produce typefaces that
align with historical typographic principles and contemporary design and
readability standards.

Incorporating complex typographic considerations into "Text to Type"
foundation models opens new avenues for automated type design,
potentially revolutionizing how designers interact with type libraries
and create custom typefaces. By leveraging deep learning to understand
and recreate the nuanced language of typography, these models could
facilitate more intuitive and precise typeface selection processes,
enhance the customization of typographic elements for specific projects,
and inspire the creation of innovative typefaces that expand traditional
typography boundaries.

Thus, studying type anatomy and integrating it into "Text to Type"
foundation models represents the convergence of art and technology,
offering exciting prospects for the future of typographic design. This
blend of historical tradition and contemporary digital practices
highlights typography's evolving nature as a discipline that continually
adapts to new tools and methodologies while preserving its rich
heritage.

**Measuring the Cognitive Properties of Type**

Assessing the cognitive properties of text involves a variety of
established techniques (Krafka K, et al., 2016; Dalmaijer, et al.,
2014), each designed to measure how textual characteristics influence
comprehension, recall, and engagement. These techniques include:

- Eye Tracking: Measures where and for how long a reader looks at
  different parts of a text, providing insights into reading patterns,
  comprehension difficulties, and interests.

- Reading Speed Tests: Evaluate how quickly text can be read while
  maintaining comprehension. This helps in understanding the legibility
  and readability of different fonts or layouts.

- Recall and Comprehension Tests: After reading, participants are asked
  to recall information or answer questions about the text. This
  assesses how well information is understood and retained.

- Dual Task Methodology: Involves having participants perform a
  secondary task while reading to measure cognitive load. The impact of
  text layout or typography on cognitive effort can be evaluated by how
  it affects performance on the secondary task.

- fMRI and EEG: Neuroimaging techniques like functional Magnetic
  Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Electroencephalography (EEG) observe
  brain activity in response to reading text. These methods can uncover
  the neural correlates of language processing and cognitive engagement.

- Think Aloud Protocols: Participants verbalize their thoughts while
  reading, offering insights into their cognitive processes, strategies,
  and areas of difficulty.

- Usability Testing: In the context of digital texts, usability tests
  assess how easily users can navigate, find information, and fulfill
  tasks, highlighting the cognitive impact of design choices.

- A/B Testing: Comparing two versions of a text to see which performs
  better in terms of reader engagement, comprehension, or preference.
  This is particularly useful in digital environments for optimizing
  content presentation.

These methods can be used individually or in combination to provide a
comprehensive understanding of how different aspects of text affect
cognitive processing, engagement, and overall reading experience.

**Difficulties in Assessing the Cognitive Properties of Typefaces**

The impact of typefaces on cognitive processes is widely recognized.
However, creating new typefaces is notoriously labor intensive. There
are numerous dimensions that influence typeface style. To identify which
dimensions affect cognition, researchers need an efficient method to
produce characters with specific traits. Although text to image models
such as Midjourney and DALL·E have produced impressive visuals, they are
not trained in the subtleties of typography and tend to generate generic
characters rather than typefaces with distinct features. Creating
figures like those in Haralambous, Y. (2007) poses a challenge using
general purpose text to image models like Midjourney, DALL·E, or Bing
Image Creator, due to their lack of specialization in typographic
nuances.

**How Type Classification is Currently Done?**

<span class="mark">Describing typefaces through comparison with others
or historical context is a nuanced method that enriches our
understanding of typography. This is evident in strategies such as the
Garamond Historical Labeling Approach, which categorizes typefaces
according to their era or artistic style, situating them within a
broader cultural and historical narrative.</span>

The Anatomy of Type approach complements historical labeling by
examining the physical features of typefaces, such as x height,
ascenders/descenders, serif styles, and stroke contrast. This method
allows for a granular classification based on visual attributes, aiding
in the selection process based on legibility, readability, and style.

<img src="media/image3.png" style="width:6.5in;height:5.15278in" />

<span class="mark">Together, these approaches enrich the toolkit of
designers, merging historical and cultural insights with detailed
typographic analysis. By understanding the origins and anatomical
features of typefaces like Garamond, designers can make informed
decisions that enhance the aesthetic and functional qualities of their
projects, ensuring typography that is not only beautiful but also deeply
rooted in history and optimally designed for its intended use.</span>

### *Historical Labeling Approach*

The historical labeling method classifies typefaces based on the period
or style of art and design with which they are associated. This approach
roots typefaces in their cultural and historical context, grouping them
into categories such as Humanist, Garalde, Transitional, Didone,
Grotesque, Neo Grotesque, Geometric, and Humanist Sans, among others.
Each of these labels not only signifies a specific time frame in
typography history but also reflects the prevailing artistic and
technological influences of that era. For instance:

### Humanist Serif

- Typefaces: Jenson, Palatino, Goudy Old Style

- Description: Very calligraphic, with a consistent stress angle and
  moderate stroke contrast. These typefaces feature bracketed, often
  asymmetrical serifs, echoing the fluidity and variance of Renaissance
  handwriting.

<img src="media/image2.png" style="width:6.5in;height:1.33333in" />

### Jenson

### Match: Nicolas Jenson's typeface, created in the 15th century, is often cited as a foundational example of Humanist Serif typography. Its design directly reflects the influence of Renaissance calligraphy, featuring a consistent stress angle that mimics the hand's movement across the page. The stroke contrast is moderate, avoiding the extremes seen in later type styles. Jenson's serifs are bracketed, contributing to a soft transition between the main strokes and the serifs, and they can exhibit some asymmetry, all of which enhance the typeface's organic, humanist qualities.

### Palatino

### Match: Designed by Hermann Zapf in the mid-20th century, Palatino was inspired by the Renaissance typefaces and specifically by the calligraphic and typographic traditions of Italy. It showcases a calligraphic flair with its varying stroke weights and a consistent stress angle. The serifs are bracketed, with a gentle curve that lends an elegant, organic feel to the text. While Palatino's serifs are more uniform than those of some early Humanist typefaces, they still reflect the characteristic Renaissance influence.

### Goudy Old Style

### Match: Goudy Old Style, designed by Frederic W. Goudy in the early 20th century, embodies many Humanist Serif characteristics. It presents a moderate stroke contrast and a warm, calligraphic quality that harks back to the fluidity of Renaissance handwriting. The serifs are bracketed, and though they may not be as asymmetrical as those found in some earlier Humanist designs, they contribute to the overall sense of warmth and approachability that defines the Humanist Serif category.

### These typefaces each exhibit key features of the Humanist Serif style, drawing inspiration from the calligraphic traditions and typographic innovations of the Renaissance. Their design elements—moderate stroke contrast, consistent stress angles, and bracketed, sometimes asymmetrical serifs—work together to create a typeface category that is both highly readable and rich in historical character.

### 

### Transitional Serif

- Typefaces: Times New Roman, Baskerville, Georgia

- Description: Slightly calligraphic, with a variable stress angle and
  usually more stroke contrast. These fonts have bracketed serifs and
  bulbous terminals, marking the evolution between old style and modern
  typefaces.

<img src="media/image1.png" style="width:6.5in;height:1.31944in" />

### Times New Roman

### Match: Times New Roman, designed by Stanley Morison and Victor Lardent in the 1930s, is a quintessential Transitional Serif. While its stroke contrast is not as pronounced as in some later Modern typefaces, it does exhibit more contrast than Old Style fonts. The serifs are bracketed, offering a smoother transition from the stem to the serif than found in Modern typefaces. Its terminals can be described as bulbous, especially in comparison to the finer, more delicate features of Modern typefaces, fitting the Transitional description well.

### Baskerville

### Match: Designed in the mid-18th century by John Baskerville, this typeface is often cited as the epitome of Transitional Serif design. Baskerville sought to improve upon the designs of his predecessors, resulting in sharper stroke contrast and more refined serifs. The typeface features variable stress angles and clearly bracketed serifs, with some terminals taking on a slightly bulbous appearance. These characteristics exemplify the shift towards more geometric, rational type design, while still retaining a nod to calligraphic origins.

### Georgia

### Partial Match: Georgia, designed by Matthew Carter in 1993 specifically for digital screens, while often categorized as a Transitional Serif, stretches the traditional boundaries of the classification. It does incorporate the slightly calligraphic nature and variable stress angles typical of Transitional typefaces. Its stroke contrast is designed to be visible on low-resolution screens, making it somewhat higher than might be expected for print-focused Transitional typefaces but still within the category's norms. Georgia's serifs are indeed bracketed, and while its terminals might not always be described as bulbous, they are designed for screen legibility, offering a modern interpretation of the Transitional style.

### These typefaces exemplify the characteristics of Transitional Serifs through their evolution from the Old Style's organic, calligraphic roots towards the sharper, more geometric qualities of Modern typefaces. The bracketed serifs, variable stress angles, and the stroke contrast of Times New Roman, Baskerville, and Georgia mark them as clear representatives of this pivotal typographic category, blending tradition with innovation to achieve broad legibility and timeless elegance.

### Rational Serif

- Typefaces: Bodoni, Didot, Walbaum

- Description: Featuring a regularized structure with vertical stress
  and moderate to high stroke contrast. Some typefaces in this category
  have thin, unbracketed serifs and ball terminals, embodying elegance
  and refinement.

### Bodoni

### Match: Bodoni, designed by Giambattista Bodoni in the late 18th century, is a quintessential example of Rational Serif design. It showcases a highly regularized structure and significant vertical stress, with characters that often have narrow underlying bodies but expand dramatically through thick vertical strokes contrasted sharply against thin horizontals and serifs. The serifs are indeed thin and unbracketed, leading to a crisp, elegant appearance. Bodoni also features ball terminals in certain characters, enhancing its refined aesthetic.

### Didot

### Match: The Didot family of typefaces, developed by Firmin Didot around the same time as Bodoni, epitomizes the Rational Serif style with its pronounced stroke contrast, vertical stress, and geometric cleanliness. Like Bodoni, Didot has thin, unbracketed serifs that contribute to its sophisticated and stylish appearance. Ball terminals are also present in specific characters, adding to the overall elegance and refinement of the typeface.

### Walbaum

### Match: Walbaum, designed by Justus Erich Walbaum in the early 19th century, although slightly later than Bodoni and Didot, fits well within the Rational Serif category. It offers a somewhat more humanist take on the Didone style, with a bit less severe stroke contrast than Bodoni or Didot but still maintaining the essential characteristics of moderate to high contrast, vertical stress, and unbracketed serifs. Walbaum's serifs are a bit more pronounced and less sharp, but it still embodies the elegance and refinement typical of Rational Serif typefaces.

### These typefaces embody the elegance and refinement associated with the Rational Serif category. Their design reflects the advancements in printing technology and the enlightenment thinking of their time, prioritizing clarity, geometric precision, and a departure from the more organic shapes of earlier designs. Bodoni, Didot, and Walbaum serve as quintessential examples of this style, each bringing its own nuances to the rationalist ideals of symmetry, vertical stress, and contrast.

### Contemporary Serif

- Typefaces: Guardian Egyptian, Serifa,
  <span class="mark">Merriweather</span>

- Description: Styles vary but most have a large x height, low stroke
  contrast, and large chunky serifs. Very open apertures, designed for
  contemporary readability and impact.

### Guardian Egyptian

- Match: Guardian Egyptian, designed for newspaper typesetting, features
  a large x-height and chunky serifs, traits that enhance its
  readability in print and digital formats. While its stroke contrast
  might not be uniformly low across all weights (some heavier weights
  exhibit more pronounced contrast), it generally aligns with the
  contemporary approach to serif design, focusing on clarity and
  legibility. The apertures are open, aiding in its effectiveness for
  both text and display use.

### Serifa

- Match: Serifa, a slab serif designed by Adrian Frutiger, indeed has a
  large x-height and significant, blocky serifs, aligning with the
  contemporary serif description. Its stroke contrast is relatively low,
  especially noticeable in its regular and medium weights, making it
  suitable for a wide range of applications. The apertures are
  sufficiently open to ensure readability, fitting well within the scope
  of contemporary serif design intended for impact and accessibility.

### Merriweather

- Match: Merriweather is a typeface specifically designed for screen
  readability, featuring a large x-height and robust, chunky serifs that
  contribute to its clear and impactful appearance. It does exhibit
  variable stroke contrast, with some weights and styles showing more
  contrast to enhance legibility across various display environments.
  The apertures are very open, consistent with the goal of optimizing
  the typeface for digital readability.

<span class="mark">Each of these typefaces embodies elements of the
Contemporary Serif category, focusing on enhanced readability, a robust
presence through large x-heights and chunky serifs, and open apertures
to ensure legibility in both print and digital media. Guardian Egyptian,
Serifa, and Merriweather, through their design choices, cater to
contemporary needs, balancing traditional serif aesthetics with the
demands of modern typography.</span>

### Inscribed/Engraved

- Typefaces: Trajan, Albertus, Copperplate

- Description: Derived from chiseled or engraved letters, these
  typefaces exhibit low stroke contrast with serifs that can be wedge
  shaped or similar to those of Humanist. Some feature flared terminals,
  reminiscent of ancient inscriptions.

### Trajan

### Trajan is based on the Roman square capitals used in ancient inscriptions, most notably seen in the Trajan Column in Rome. This typeface showcases low stroke contrast, typical of letters carved into stone, where uniformity in stroke width was a natural outcome of the carving process. Trajan's serifs are not pronounced in the traditional sense, as it mimics the capital letters from Roman times, but the overall effect resembles the wedge-shaped serifs mentioned. The terminals of Trajan are indeed flared, echoing the elegance of ancient inscriptions.

### Albertus

### Albertus, designed by Berthold Wolpe, is influenced by monumental Roman lettering but with a modern twist. It features somewhat low stroke contrast, aligning with the characteristics of inscribed or engraved typefaces. While Albertus may not have the typical wedge-shaped serifs of classical Humanist typefaces, its serifs and terminals possess a unique form that suggests a crafted, chiseled quality, reminiscent of historical inscriptions. The flared terminals and the slightly unconventional shape of the letters give Albertus an engraved appearance.

### Copperplate

### Copperplate Gothic, unlike Trajan and Albertus, is more directly tied to the look of engraved lettering, specifically that which was common in the stationery and engraving practices of the 19th and early 20th centuries. It exhibits very low stroke contrast, as its design mimics the uniform line weight produced by engraving tools. While Copperplate doesn't have traditional serifs due to its all-caps design, its letters have a squared-off termination that can be seen as a nod to the wedge-shaped quality described. Its design ethos is clearly inspired by the precision and formality of engraved lettering.

<span class="mark">Each of these typefaces embodies the essence of
inscribed or engraved letterforms through their design characteristics.
Trajan brings the ancient world's monumental inscriptions into digital
typography, Albertus offers a modern interpretation of Roman lettering
with a crafted feel, and Copperplate directly references the engraved
lettering style that was popular in printed stationery. Together, they
represent a diverse yet cohesive group of typefaces that accurately fit
the description of Inscribed/Engraved, each with its own unique
qualities and historical references.</span>

### Grotesque Sans

- Typefaces: Akzidenz Grotesk, Franklin Gothic, News Gothic

- Description: Sharing structural similarities with Transitional or
  Rational Serif typefaces, these fonts have low stroke contrast and
  fairly regular proportions, with round shapes often appearing oval
  rather than circular.

### Akzidenz Grotesk

- As one of the first sans serif typefaces to gain widespread use,
  Akzidenz Grotesk exhibits the quintessential qualities of the
  Grotesque Sans category. It has low stroke contrast, embodying the
  utilitarian clarity that defined early sans serif designs. The
  proportions of Akzidenz Grotesk are fairly regular, with a functional,
  almost austere appearance. Its round shapes, such as 'O' and 'G,' tend
  to have a slightly oval appearance, a characteristic feature of many
  Grotesque Sans typefaces that adds to their distinctive charm.

### Franklin Gothic

- Franklin Gothic, designed by Morris Fuller Benton in the early 20th
  century, is a prime example of the American take on the Grotesque Sans
  style. It too has low stroke contrast, which contributes to its
  versatility and enduring popularity in a wide range of applications.
  The proportions of Franklin Gothic are more varied than those of
  Akzidenz Grotesk, with a somewhat more condensed feel, but it still
  maintains the regularity associated with Grotesque Sans typefaces. Its
  round characters exhibit the slight oval quality described, enhancing
  its overall typographic texture.

### News Gothic

- Another creation by Morris Fuller Benton, News Gothic shares many
  characteristics with Franklin Gothic but with its own distinct
  nuances. Like other Grotesque Sans typefaces, it features low stroke
  contrast and regular proportions, making it highly readable and
  suitable for both text and display use. The round characters in News
  Gothic, while subtle, also lean towards the oval shape mentioned in
  the description, which is a hallmark of this typographic style.

<span class="mark">These typefaces exemplify the Grotesque Sans category
through their design principles, which prioritize functionality and
clarity. Their low stroke contrast, regular proportions, and the
specific treatment of round shapes, which may appear more oval,
contribute to their effectiveness and durability in a vast array of
typographic contexts. While sharing structural similarities with
Transitional or Rational Serif typefaces in terms of uniformity and
proportion, Akzidenz Grotesk, Franklin Gothic, and News Gothic
distinctly embody the Grotesque Sans aesthetic with their unique
characteristics and historical significance.</span>

### Neo Grotesque Sans

- Typefaces: Helvetica, Univers, Arial

- Description: An evolution of the Grotesque style, with more
  homogeneous forms, minimal stroke contrast, closed apertures, and
  horizontal terminals. Round shapes are more circular, epitomizing mid
  20th century sans serif design.

### Helvetica

- Designed by Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffmann in 1957, Helvetica is
  perhaps the quintessential example of the Neo Grotesque style. It
  showcases homogeneous forms with a very minimal stroke contrast,
  aiming for an almost seamless uniformity across different characters.
  The apertures are more closed compared to older Grotesque designs,
  which enhances its legibility in a wide range of sizes and mediums.
  Helvetica's round shapes, such as 'O' and 'C,' are more true to the
  circular form, and its terminals are horizontal, embodying the clean,
  functional aesthetic of mid-20th-century typography.

### Univers

- Adrian Frutiger's Univers, also created in the 1950s, is another
  landmark Neo Grotesque typeface that emphasizes uniformity and
  clarity. Like Helvetica, Univers features minimal stroke contrast and
  homogeneous character shapes. Its design includes relatively closed
  apertures and horizontal terminals, which contribute to its clear,
  objective appearance. The round shapes in Univers are designed to be
  more circular, aligning with the desire for simplicity and neutrality.

### Arial

- Although often compared to Helvetica for its similarities, Arial,
  designed by Robin Nicholas and Patricia Saunders in the early 1980s,
  fits within the Neo Grotesque category. It presents minimal stroke
  contrast and features that are characteristic of the style, such as
  closed apertures and horizontal terminals. Arial’s round shapes are
  also more circular, aiming for straightforward legibility. While Arial
  was created later and for digital use, it embodies the principles of
  mid-20th-century Neo Grotesque design with its uniform, clean
  appearance.

### <span class="mark">These typefaces exemplify the Neo Grotesque movement by refining and simplifying the Grotesque tradition, focusing on legibility, neutrality, and a modern aesthetic. Their design principles—homogeneous forms, minimal stroke contrast, more circular round shapes, and the specific use of closed apertures and horizontal terminals—mark a significant evolution in sans serif typography, making them enduring favorites in a wide array of graphic design applications.</span>

### Gothic Sans

- Typefaces: Trade Gothic, News Gothic, Franklin Gothic

- Description: An American variant of the Grotesque style, with simpler,
  more static forms. Features usually include a large x height, low
  stroke contrast, and a condensed width, suitable for display and text.

### Trade Gothic

- Designed by Jackson Burke in the mid-20th century, Trade Gothic is a
  quintessential example of the Gothic Sans style. It is known for its
  straightforward, no-nonsense appearance, featuring simpler and more
  static forms than its European Grotesque counterparts. Trade Gothic
  has a large x-height and low stroke contrast, which contribute to its
  legibility and versatility. While it comes in various widths, many of
  its styles lean towards the condensed, making it particularly
  effective for display use while still being readable in text sizes.

### News Gothic

- News Gothic, designed by Morris Fuller Benton in the early 20th
  century, predates Trade Gothic but shares many of the same design
  philosophies. It too has a large x-height and low stroke contrast,
  hallmarks of the Gothic Sans category. News Gothic's forms are simpler
  and more uniform, making it highly legible and adaptable to both text
  and display contexts. Its widths vary, but overall, the typeface
  maintains a relatively condensed appearance without sacrificing
  readability.

### Franklin Gothic

- Another of Benton's creations, Franklin Gothic, embodies the Gothic
  Sans characteristics with its straightforward, effective design. It
  features a large x-height and low stroke contrast, consistent with the
  description. Franklin Gothic's width is more varied across its family,
  offering both standard and condensed options, but always maintains the
  functional simplicity suitable for a wide range of applications, from
  advertising to body text.

<span class="mark">These typefaces exemplify the American Gothic Sans
style through their design attributes—emphasizing clarity, efficiency,
and versatility. Their large x-heights enhance legibility, low stroke
contrast ensures readability at various sizes, and the generally
condensed widths make them ideal for both display and text purposes.
Trade Gothic, News Gothic, and Franklin Gothic, with their simpler, more
static forms compared to European Grotesques, represent a distinctly
American interpretation of the Grotesque tradition, widely used across
many areas of graphic design.</span>

### Geometric Sans

- Typefaces: Futura, Avenir, Century Gothic

- Description: Characterized by static and clinical construction, these
  typefaces are made of shapes that are nearly circular or square, with
  minimal stroke contrast, embodying geometric purity.

### Futura

- Designed by Paul Renner in the 1920s, Futura is a seminal Geometric
  Sans typeface that truly embodies the principles of geometric purity.
  Its design is based on simple geometric forms, with circles,
  triangles, and squares making up the shapes of the letters. Futura
  features minimal stroke contrast and utilizes nearly perfect round
  shapes for letters like 'O,' and the construction is indeed static and
  clinical, emphasizing functionality and forward-thinking design.

### Avenir

- Created by Adrian Frutiger in 1988, Avenir (French for "future") was
  designed as a more humanist take on the geometric style, aiming to be
  more harmonious and suitable for extended reading. Despite this,
  Avenir still adheres to the geometric principles, with letters
  constructed from circular and square shapes. It maintains minimal
  stroke contrast and a clean, clinical appearance, but with a slightly
  warmer, more approachable character than more rigid geometric sans
  serifs.

### Century Gothic

- Century Gothic, designed by Sol Hess in the 1990s as a digital
  typeface, draws inspiration from Futura and other geometric typefaces
  of the early 20th century. It is characterized by its open, circular
  letterforms, minimal stroke contrast, and a generally static,

### *Anatomy of Type Approach*

The Anatomy of Type approach, on the other hand, focuses on the physical
characteristics of typefaces, such as x height, ascenders and
descenders, serif styles, stroke contrast, and counter shapes. This
method offers a more granular and objective way to classify and
differentiate typefaces based on their visual attributes. Key aspects
include:

- X height: The height of lowercase letters, excluding ascenders and
  descenders. Typefaces with a high x height are often perceived as more
  legible at small sizes.

- Ascenders and Descenders: The parts of letters that extend above the x
  height and below the baseline, respectively. The length and treatment
  of these can significantly affect the overall appearance and
  readability of a typeface.

- Serif Styles: The presence, shape, and design of serifs contribute to
  the classification of a typeface as either serif, slab serif, or sans
  serif, with further distinctions within each category based on the
  serifs’ design.

- Stroke Contrast: The variation between thick and thin parts of
  letters. High contrast might indicate a more classical or formal
  typeface, while low contrast is typical of sans serif and modern
  styles.

**Using Typefaces as a Reference**

By focusing on these and other typographic features, the Anatomy of Type
approach provides a detailed framework for understanding the subtle
differences between typefaces. This method is invaluable for designers
focusing on legibility, readability, and stylistic coherence in their
projects, allowing for nuanced selection and application of typefaces
based on specific design criteria.

Together, the historical labeling and Anatomy of Type approaches offer
complementary perspectives on type classification. While historical
labeling connects typefaces to their cultural and temporal origins, the
Anatomy of Type approach provides a detailed analysis of their visual
characteristics, enabling designers to make informed decisions based on
both context and aesthetics.

**Axes of Variation in Variable Fonts**

We begin our exploration of the Abecedarian Axes of Variation by delving
into its foundation, the OpenType specification (OpenType 1.8), which
heralded the introduction of variable fonts. These innovative fonts
enable multiple variations of a typeface within a single file,
encompassing changes in weight, width, slant, and other design aspects.
This advancement significantly boosts file size efficiency and
flexibility, facilitating dynamic text styling and animation in digital
media. Since its collaborative development by major tech companies like
Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Adobe in September 2016, variable fonts
have marked a considerable progression in digital typography, offering
practical benefits and creative possibilities.

Variable fonts, also known as OpenType Font Variations, optimize
typography by merging various weights and styles into a single file.
This not only reduces the overall file size—vital for web typography—but
also provides users with unparalleled control over typography
customization. Users can dynamically fine tune text appearance,
selecting any point along a design variation axis to achieve the ideal
weight, width, or slant. Such a degree of customization, previously
unachievable with traditional static font files, signifies a significant
advancement in font technology.

Moreover, variable fonts accommodate multiple axes for variation,
enabling designers to modify slant, width, optical size, and even
unconventional parameters like temperature. Despite this adaptability,
familiar style names such as light, regular, and bold remain accessible
as "named instances" in font menus, maintaining ease of use.

Our objective is to further enhance the OpenType specification's
capabilities through "Text to Type" foundation models, tackling the
challenges associated with creating specific letterforms, calligraphic,
and non Latin typefaces using variable fonts. In doing so, we aim to
improve fonts' programmability and legibility, as demonstrated by the
diverse and appealing fonts available on Google Fonts, and to advance
the boundaries of typographic design.

To simplify, imagine variable fonts as a slider (or axis), with the
lightest weight at one end, regular in the middle, and the heaviest
weight at the other. Unlike the past, where we had to choose from fixed
points determined by the type designer, we can now select any point
along the scale. This flexibility allows for precise adjustments, such
as choosing a weight of 742, which may be just right compared to the
predefined bold or extra bold options.

The true strength of variable fonts lies in their ability to combine any
variables across multiple axes as chosen by the type designer, including
slant, width, optical size, and even temperature. Importantly, even with
the adoption of variable fonts, familiar style names for weight and
width still appear in font menus as "named instances," ensuring that
users don't lose the convenience of traditional labels and shared
styles.

To effectively grasp the concept of variable fonts, engaging with them
directly is key, and it's possible to do so without the need for
installing any fonts or coding. Here are several suggestions on how to
experiment with variable fonts and the outcomes you should observe. The
best way to understand variable fonts is to start playing with them—and
in a way that doesn’t require you to install any font files or write any
code. To explore the dynamics of variable fonts, visit these websites

# **Vox ATypI Classification**

The ATypI Classification, also known as the Vox ATypI classification, is
a system used to categorize typefaces based on their characteristics and
historical influences. Originally devised by French typographer
Maximilien Vox in 1954, it was later adopted and expanded by the
Association Typographique Internationale (ATypI). This system classifies
typefaces into 11 main categories, each reflecting distinct stylistic
and historical attributes. These categories provide a framework for
understanding the evolution of typeface design and for identifying the
visual and structural characteristics of different fonts. Here's a
detailed look at each category within the Vox ATypI classification:

### Humanist Serif

- Typefaces: Adobe Jenson, Cala, Bembo Book, FF Clifford, FF Scala,
  Lexicon, Minion, Garamond Premier, MVB Verdigris

- Description: Inspired by the handwriting of Italian Renaissance
  scribes, Humanist Serif typefaces exhibit a strong calligraphic
  influence, evident in their varied stroke weights and serifs that
  resemble pen strokes.

### Transitional Serif

- Typefaces: Adobe Caslon, Baskerville Original, Mrs Eaves, Plantin,
  Arnhem, Times New Roman, Le Monde Journal

- Description: Transitional Serif fonts, epitomized by John
  Baskerville's work in the 18th century, feature greater contrast
  between thick and thin lines, sharper serifs, and a more vertical
  axis, marking the evolution from Garalde to Didone styles.

### Rational Serif (Didone)

- Typefaces: Bauer Bodoni, ITC Bodoni, HandFJ Didot, Filosofia, Farnham,
  New Century Schoolbook, Miller, Eames Century Modern, Ingeborg, Melior

- Description: Characterized by strong contrast between thick and thin
  lines, narrow and unbracketed serifs, and a vertical stress in the
  letters, Didone typefaces emerged in the late 18th century, associated
  with designers like Firmin Didot and Giambattista Bodoni.

### Contemporary Serif

- Typefaces: Neue Swift, Skolar, Fedra Serif, FF Meta Serif, Doko

- Description: Modern serifs that may incorporate features from both
  transitional and humanist serifs but with contemporary design twists.
  They often experiment with letterforms to provide fresh, innovative
  appearances.

### Inscribed/Engraved (Glyphic)

- Typefaces: Luxury Diamond, Albertus, Modesto, Trajan

# **The Alessandrini Classification of Typefaces: Codex 80**

The Alessandrini Classification of Typefaces, introduced in Codex 80 by
Jean Alessandrini in 1979, offers a detailed and innovative approach to
categorizing typefaces, drawing inspiration from the biological
classification of species. This classification is distinctive for its
comprehensive framework, including 19 preliminary designations, two
orthogonal modifiers, and five additional lists of qualifiers, enriched
with creative neologisms and a touch of humor. Here's a detailed
breakdown of how this classification works:

### Preliminary Désignations (Dénominations Préliminaires)

Alessandrini introduces 19 preliminary categories for typefaces, each
with unique characteristics:

### Simplices

- Typefaces: Helvetica, Arial, Futura

    several categories, from light to bold, demonstrating versatility
    and a wide range of expression within a single type family.

### Orthogonal Modifiers (Éventualités)

Two orthogonal qualifications complement the preliminary designations:

1.  Diagones: Pertains to italics and slanted typefaces, with variations
    like mini diagones, maxi diagones, and anti diagones indicating the
    degree of slope.

2.  Stenciliennes: Refers to stenciled letters, popular in the 1970s.

### *Additional Lists of Qualifiers*

Alessandrini further refines classification with five lists of
qualifiers:

1.  Objective Formal Considerations: Includes attributes like light,
    bold, extended, shadowed, three dimensional, etc.

2.  Historical Reference Points: Lists periods like Archaic,
    Renaissance, Modern, etc.

3.  Aesthetic and Stylistic Considerations: Features styles like
    Classical, Baroque, Pop, etc.

4.  Subjective Formal Considerations: Offers a list that can be extended
    to include terms like monotone, expressive, dramatic, etc.

5.  Geographic Areas and Original Aspects: Focuses on the geographical
    origin of typefaces.

This classification system stands out for its depth, flexibility, and
the creative lexicon introduced by Alessandrini. Despite receiving a
lukewarm reception from the printing profession, largely due to its
departure from tradition and the emphasis on 1970s typefaces,
Alessandrini's Codex 80 offers a rich, albeit unconventional, framework
for understanding and categorizing the diversity of typefaces beyond the
constraints of earlier systems.

# **The Panose 1 Classification**

The Panose 1 Classification is a detailed system for describing Latin
fonts through a 10 number code, each ranging from 0 to 15, representing
various typographic attributes. This method turns a font into a vector
in a 10 dimensional space, allowing for the calculation of the distance
between two fonts based on their characteristics such as family kind,
serif style, weight, proportion, contrast, stroke variation, arm style,
letterform, midline, and x height. Originally developed by Ben
Bauermeister around 1982, Panose 1 was integrated into TrueType and
Windows 3.1 by Microsoft in 1990, showcasing its utility in font
identification and compatibility across digital platforms.

The Panose 1 Classification system uses a 10 number code to describe key
characteristics of Latin typefaces. Each digit in this code represents a
different attribute of a font, such as its family kind, serif style,
weight, proportion, and contrast among others. This allows for precise
identification and matching of fonts by comparing these attributes. The
system enables a nuanced approach to font classification, facilitating
the selection and pairing of typefaces in digital design and typography
by quantifying typographic similarities in a standardized format.

The Panose 1 Classification system is detailed and structured around 10
key characteristics, each providing a nuanced approach to font
classification. These characteristics are as follows:

1.  Family Kind: Classifies the overall type of the font, with six
    possible values:

    - 0: Any type of font

    - 1: No fit with any other types

    - 2: Latin text

    - 3: Handwritten

    - 4: Decorative

    - 5: Symbol font

2.  Serif Style: Focuses on the serif design, offering 16 possibilities
    ranging from no serif to various serif styles like cove, square,
    thin, oval, triangle, and rounded.

3.  Weight: Describes the font's weight from very light to extra black,
    indicating the visual heaviness of the stroke.

4.  Proportion: Identifies the font's proportion, including old style,
    modern, even width, extended, condensed, very extended, very
    condensed, and monospaced.

5.  Contrast: Measures the difference between the thickest and thinnest
    parts of the letters, from no contrast to very high contrast.

6.  Stroke Variation: Examines how the stroke width changes across a
    character, including no variation, gradual/diagonal,
    gradual/vertical, rapid/vertical, and instant variations.

7.  Arm Style and Termination of Open Curves: Looks at the style of the
    font's arms (straight or not) and the termination of open curves,
    differentiating between horizontal, wedge, and vertical
    terminations, with or without serifs.

8.  Slant and Shape of the Letter 'O': Assesses the slant (normal or
    oblique) and the overall shape of the letter 'O', such as contact,
    weighted, boxed, flattened, rounded, off center, and square.

9.  Midlines and Apexes: Focuses on the height of the midlines
    (standard, high, constant, low) and the style of the apexes
    (trimmed, pointed, serifed) of letters like 'E' and 'A'.

10. X Height and Behavior of Uppercase Letters Relative to Accents:
    Addresses the ratio of lowercase letter height to uppercase letter
    height and notes any peculiar behavior in accented uppercase
    letters.

This comprehensive classification allows for a detailed analysis and
comparison of typefaces, enabling designers to find fonts with similar
characteristics or to understand the nuanced differences between fonts
in a systematic manner.

## **IBM's Classification of Fonts**

IBM's Classification of Fonts, utilized in the OS/2 table of TrueType
fonts, divides typefaces into 10 classes, each with specific subclasses
to further categorize fonts based on characteristics and historical
context. This system includes:

### Class 0: No Classification

  styles to formal calligraphy, without distinguishing between manual
  and script typefaces, and including variations like uncial and formal
  joined scripts.

IBM's Classification of Fonts provides a detailed framework for
categorizing typefaces based on visual characteristics, historical
context, and stylistic features, facilitating a comprehensive
understanding and selection of fonts for various design needs.

Each class and subclass provides a framework to classify fonts by their
visual characteristics, historical origins, and stylistic features.

# **DIN 16518**

The DIN 16518 classification system is a German standard for
categorizing typefaces based on their characteristics and historical
development. Established by the Deutsches Institut für Normung (German
Institute for Standardization), this system organizes typefaces into
groups that reflect their stylistic and structural features. Unlike the
Panose 1 system, which is based on specific, quantifiable attributes of
typefaces, the DIN 16518 system groups typefaces more historically and
stylistically. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the DIN 16518
classification system works:

### Group I: Venetian Renaissance Antiqua (Venetian)

- Typefaces: Jenson, Centaur, Poliphilus

- Description: Characterized by low contrast between thick and thin
  strokes, diagonal stress on curves, and slanted serifs, these
  typefaces are inspired by the early Italian Renaissance, reminiscent
  of the works by Aldus Manutius.

### Group II: French Renaissance Antiqua (Garalde)

- Typefaces: Garamond, Sabon, Granjon

- Description: With increased contrast between thick and thin strokes
  compared to Venetian Antiquas, a more vertical stress, and bracketed
  serifs, this group includes typefaces inspired by Claude Garamond and
  his contemporaries.

### Group III: Baroque Antiqua (Transitional)

- Typefaces: Times New Roman, Baskerville, Caslon

- Description: Featuring even greater contrast between thick and thin
  strokes, less pronounced bracketing on serifs, and a more vertical
  axis, Transitional typefaces bridge the gap between Garalde and Didone
  styles.

### Group IV: Classical Antiqua (Didone)

- Typefaces: Bodoni, Didot, Walbaum

- Description: Marked by strong contrast between thick and thin strokes,
  straight serifs without brackets, and a strictly vertical stress,
  these typefaces emerged in the late 18th century.

### Group V: Slab Serif (Egyptian)

- Typefaces: Rockwell, Clarendon, Serifa

- Description: Characterized by thick, block like serifs and little to
  no contrast between thick and thin strokes, this group was designed
  for advertising and display purposes.

### Group VI: Grotesque Sans Serif

- Typefaces: Akzidenz Grotesk, Franklin Gothic, Monotype Grotesque

- Description: Featuring uniform stroke width and no serifs, with a
  somewhat crude and irregular design, these are early sans serif
  designs from the 19th and early 20th centuries.

### Group VII: Neo Grotesque Sans Serif

- Typefaces: Helvetica, Univers, Arial

- Description: More refined than grotesque sans serifs, with uniform
  stroke width and a more harmonious geometric structure.

### Group VIII: Geometric Sans Serif

- Typefaces: Futura, Avant Garde, Avenir

- Description: Simple, geometric shapes form the basis of letterforms,
  with uniform stroke width and no serifs, exemplified by Futura.

### Group IX: Humanist Sans Serif

- Typefaces: Gill Sans, Optima, Frutiger

- Description: Showing variation in stroke width and more organic,
  calligraphic forms, these typefaces reflect humanist handwriting
  influences.

### Group X: Scripts and Calligraphic Typefaces

- Typefaces: Loos, Tannenberg, Kabel

- Description: A subset of Blackletter, including typefaces with a more
  'broken' appearance, typically used in Germany until the mid 20th
  century.

The DIN 16518 system provides a historical and stylistic framework for
classifying typefaces, emphasizing the evolution of type design from the
Renaissance to the modern era. By grouping typefaces into these
categories, the system helps users understand the historical context and
stylistic nuances of different fonts, aiding in the selection process
for various typographic projects.

# **Bringhurst's System**

Robert Bringhurst's system for classifying typefaces, detailed in his
seminal work "The Elements of Typographic Style," proposes a more
nuanced and historical approach compared to many classification systems
like Panose 1. Bringhurst's system is deeply rooted in the history of
typography and the evolution of typeface design, reflecting a blend of
technical, cultural, and aesthetic considerations. Unlike systems that
categorize typefaces based on specific physical characteristics alone,
Bringhurst's method also considers the historical and stylistic lineage
of typefaces.

While Bringhurst does not lay out a simple, numbered classification
system akin to DIN 16518 or the Vox ATypI classification, his approach
can be summarized by identifying key historical and stylistic periods of
type design, each with its defining characteristics. Here’s an overview
inspired by the principles found in "The Elements of Typographic Style,"
tailored to resemble the structure requested:

### Humanist or Old Style

- Typefaces: Garamond, Palatino, Bembo

- Description: Reflecting the influence of early Italian Renaissance
  letterforms, these typefaces are characterized by moderate contrast
  between thick and thin strokes, a diagonal stress, and bracketed
  serifs, mimicking the look of pen drawn letters.

### Transitional

- Typefaces: Times New Roman, Baskerville, Georgia

- Description: Marking the evolution from Old Style to Modern typefaces,
  Transitional styles feature greater contrast between thick and thin
  strokes, more vertical stress, and less pronounced bracketing on the
  serifs, bridging old and new.

### Neoclassical and Didone

- Typefaces: Bodoni, Didot, Walbaum

- Description: Known for extreme contrast between thick and thin
  strokes, a vertical axis, and fine, unbracketed serifs, these
  typefaces emerged in the late 18th century, showcasing elegance and
  precision.

### Slab Serif

- Typefaces: Rockwell, Clarendon, Courier

- Description: Features robust, block like serifs and minimal contrast
  between strokes. Originating in the 19th century, this style offers a
  range from geometric to more humanist approaches.

### Sans Serif

- Typefaces: Helvetica, Arial, Futura

- Description: Encompassing a broad category from Grotesque to
  Geometric, Humanist, and Neo grotesque designs, these typefaces are
  defined by the absence of serifs, showcasing various letter shapes
  based on geometric simplicity or more organic, humanist forms.

### Script

- Typefaces: Kinescope, Studio Slant, Radio, Bickham Script, Tangier,
  Suomi Hand Script

- Description: Includes typefaces that resemble handwritten text, from
  formal, elegant scripts to casual, informal styles, mimicking the
  fluidity and variance of handwriting.

### Blackletter

- Typefaces: Fraktur, Old English, Textura

- Description: Characterized by dense, intricate letterforms reminiscent
  of medieval manuscript calligraphy, this style is distinguished by its
  textured, ornate appearance.

### Decorative and Display

- Typefaces: Lobster, Cooper Black, Papyrus

- Description: A broad category encompassing a variety of typefaces
  designed for specific uses or effects, or to capture attention, often
  prioritizing aesthetic expression over readability.

### Non Latin Scripts

- Typefaces: Noto Sans (covering multiple scripts), Arial Unicode MS

- Description: Acknowledges the vast diversity of type design beyond the
  Latin alphabet, covering scripts from around the world, each with its
  own historical and cultural significance, including Arabic, Cyrillic,
  and Devanagari.

Bringhurst’s system is deeply informative, providing insight into the
evolution of typeface design and encouraging typographers to consider
the historical context and intended use of typefaces in their work. This
approach helps designers make more informed choices that enhance the
readability, beauty, and function of printed and digital texts.

**Thibaudeau Classification**

The Thibaudeau Classification is a method of organizing typefaces into
distinct families based on their form and serif characteristics.
Developed in 1921 by French typographer Francis Thibaudeau, it
categorizes typefaces into four main groups. The system was further
refined by Maximilien Vox in 1954 and expanded into the VOX-ATypI
classification with 11 families in 1962 by the Association Typographique
Internationale (ATypI). Despite these expansions, Thibaudeau's original
classification remains valued for its simplicity and ease of
understanding. Thibaudeau also introduced additional categories for
scripts (Écritures) and display typefaces (Fantaisies) to accommodate a
broader range of type designs.

### *Classification Categories*

### Elzévirs

> Typefaces: Garamond, Palatino, Times Roman, Bembo, Sabon, Minion
>
> Description: Elzévirs are characterized by their triangular serifs and
> moderate stroke contrast, often associated with the Renaissance or

This classification system aids in understanding the vast landscape of
typography by grouping typefaces into easily recognizable families based
on their most distinctive features.

# **The British Standards Classification of Typefaces (BS 2961)**

The British Standards Classification of Typefaces (BS 2961) is a system
developed in the United Kingdom for classifying typefaces
systematically. Unlike the more general and stylistic approaches such as
the ATypI (Vox ATypI) classification, the BS 2961 standard provides a
structured method, focusing on specific attributes of typefaces to
categorize them. While it shares the goal of classifying typefaces to
facilitate understanding and selection, the specifics of the BS 2961
system are distinct and tailored to align with British standards for
typography.

However, as of my last update, detailed, attribute by attribute
breakdowns similar to the Panose 1 system for BS 2961 specifically were
not widely documented or disseminated in public resources. The British
Standards Classification system was designed to cover various aspects of
typography and printing practices, but the detailed attributes it uses
for classifying typefaces—such as serif style, weight, proportion, and
others—are not as publicly and precisely outlined as in the Panose 1
system.

The BS 2961 system would likely categorize typefaces based on several
key attributes, potentially including:

1.  Typeface Family: Similar to Panose 1's Family Kind, classifying
    typefaces into broad categories based on their general appearance
    and purpose (e.g., serif, sans serif, script).

2.  Serif Style: Identifying the style of serifs if present, which could
    range from traditional to contemporary, and including specific
    shapes and forms.

3.  Weight: The visual heaviness of the typeface, from light to bold or
    black, affecting readability and emphasis in text.

4.  Width/Proportion: The relative width of characters, which could
    influence text density and aesthetic appeal.

5.  X Height: The height of lowercase letters relative to capital
    letters, affecting readability and overall visual balance.

6.  Contrast: The degree of variation between thick and thin strokes
    within characters, a feature that can dramatically affect the
    typeface's character.

While this structure would logically align with the principles of type
classification, the specific implementation of these or other attributes
in BS 2961 is less commonly discussed in widely accessible typographic
literature or resources. The system was intended for use within the UK's
printing and design industries to standardize typeface classification,
which could include more technical specifications and standards relevant
to those fields.
