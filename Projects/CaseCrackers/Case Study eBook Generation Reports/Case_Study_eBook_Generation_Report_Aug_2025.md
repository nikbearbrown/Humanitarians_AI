## Abstract

This project explores the development and implementation of an AI-driven case study eBook generation framework that transforms traditional educational content creation through automated, scalable production methodologies. Moving beyond conventional manual case study development, this work establishes a comprehensive system that integrates artificial intelligence with established business education frameworks to produce professional-quality educational materials across multiple domains.

The research incorporates three foundational technical components: OpenAI GPT-4 integration for natural language generation, Supabase database architecture for content management, and automated eBook formatting with embedded business frameworks. Through extensive analysis of system architecture including multi-phase content generation, dynamic visualization creation, and professional document formatting, the project demonstrates how AI can be operationalized in educational content production while maintaining pedagogical rigor.

Key findings reveal critical capabilities in automated educational content generation, with documented success in producing comprehensive case studies across five business domains: Management, Product Management, Healthcare, Financial, and Marketing. The framework addresses traditional educational scalability challenges through systematic content generation including 17 integrated business frameworks, automated Python code generation for visualizations, and professional eBook output with consistent formatting.

The project establishes measurable improvements in content production efficiency while identifying areas requiring validation enhancement. Results demonstrate successful automation of complex educational workflows including multi-stage prompting, error handling protocols, and cross-domain framework integration. These outcomes illustrate the potential for AI-assisted educational technology while highlighting the critical importance of maintaining academic standards in automated learning environments.

This work contributes to the emerging field of AI-driven educational technology by providing both technical implementation frameworks and critical analysis of automation challenges in academic content creation. The research has implications for business education, professional training, and scalable learning resource development across multiple educational contexts.
