_Case Interview Guidelines_

# 1. Guidelines for Case Interview
## 1) Pay Attention to the Question
## 2) Maintain Detailed Notes
## 3) Paraphrase the Question
- To demonstrate active listening
- To review the question a second time
- To avoid responding to an incorrect question
- To buy some thinking time

## 4) Confirm the Goals
## 5) Pose Clarifying Questions
- To obtain extra information to help you categorize and comprehend the question
- To prove to the interviewer that you are comfortable asking penetrating questions
- To turn the interview into a dialog

> Early in the case, you have a wide scope for questioning. Start with fundamental questions about the company, industry, competition, external market factors, and the product. As the case progresses, your queries should gradually transition from open-ended to more specific ones. You may find yourself struggling when you pose expansive, general questions that are challenging for the interviewer to respond to. Such questions can give the impression that you want the interviewer to solve the case for you. (from Case in Point 9th)

## 6) Arrange Your Response
## 7) Refrain From Sharing Unformed Thoughts
## 8) Control Your Time
- Answers should be sequential and clear-cut
- Begin from a larger perspective
- Stay attentive to the original question
- Don't lose sight of the question, the objective, or the structure

## 9) Handle Numerical Data
- When performing calculations, clarify your thought process and method.

## 10) Display Willingness to Learn
- Pay attention to the feedback from the interviewer
- Seek assistance when required

## 11) Showcase Creativity and Problem-Solving Skills
## 12) Display Positivity and Enthusiasm
## 13) Wrap Up and Recap

# 2 Categories of Case Questions
## 1) Market-sizing Questions
- Logical assumption is essential
> Tell the interviewer: "I’m not that familiar with this market, so if my assumptions are off, please correct me."

- Essential figures to memorize:
  - U.S. population is 320 million
  - The average lifespan of an American is 80 years
  - Assume equal distribution across age groups: implying there are as many 2-year-olds as 72-year-olds. While this isn't accurate, for the sake of this case, it's a reasonable assumption, thus 4 million people per age group.
  - 80 million individuals per generation
  - 100 million U.S. households
## 2) Component Questions
## 3) Business Scenario Questions

# 3 Case Structure
A structure is a tool that aids in the systematic organization and analysis of the case.

## Two segments:
### Initial five steps:
1. Paraphrase the Question: Ensure you have the correct figures (repeat the figures);
**Tip:** Convert the numbers into percentages.
2. Confirm the objectives.
3. Pose clarifying Questions (only when you fail to understand the question)
4. Tag the case and present your structure (60s-90s)
5. Propose your theory

### Heart of the case
- The Company and the Market

### Four Key case scenarios
#### Profit and loss
- The framework involves Economy * (Profit = Revenue - Cost ) * Market
#### Entering a new market
"Why does the company wish to enter this market?" is the first crucial question to ask your interviewer!
1. Start by asking about the company
2. Assess the current and future market condition
3. Evaluate the market to determine if entry would be a wise business move.
4. If decided to enter, what is the most effective entry strategy? **Starting from scratch; acquisition; forming a joint venture; or outsourcing.**

#### Pricing (Company S is launching a new product. What should be its price?)
1. What is the goal? - profit, market share, or brand positioning? How significant is it? What products does it have?
2. Examine the product: competitive analysis; cost-based pricing, and price-based costing.
3. Consider the product as a service, not just a standalone product.

#### Growth and sales enhancement
1. Explore the industry
2. Investigate the company
