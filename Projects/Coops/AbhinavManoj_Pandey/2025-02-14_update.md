# Bi-Weekly Update: Feb 1 - Feb 14, 2025

### Summary of Work Completed
- Joined the Simulation Engine project and completed onboarding
- Created comprehensive system design for application architecture
- Developed project management structure with GitHub issues and task assignments
- Built MVP for base agent, replication engine, and simulation engine
- Led follow-up meetings to track progress and coordinate development efforts

### Tasks and Hours Breakdown
| Task | Hours |
|------|-------|
| Simulation Engine onboarding and initial research | 12 |
| System design documentation for application architecture | 18 |
| GitHub project setup and task management | 8 |
| Development of base agent component | 16 |
| Development of replication engine component | 16 |
| Integration of components into simulation engine MVP | 10 |
| Team meetings and progress check-ins | 4 |
| **Total Hours** | **80** |

### Challenges Encountered
- Complex requirements for the simulation engine required additional architectural planning
- Scalability concerns with the replication engine when handling multiple agent instances

### Goals for Next Two Weeks
- Develop module for importing configuration to replicate base agents
- Write comprehensive test suite for simulation engine components
- Design and implement feedback analysis output structure from critic agent
- Continue progress tracking and follow-up meetings with team

### Resources or Assistance Needed
- Feedback on initial MVP
- Additional test scenarios for simulation validation
