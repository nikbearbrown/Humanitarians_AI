### Challenges Encountered
- Web retrieval quality varied significantly based on search queries and sources

### Goals for Next Two Weeks
- Develop RAG system to store results from web research tool
- Create MCP client application integrating inference LLM
- Develop UI for sending problem statements to LLM for decomposition
- Connect UI with MCP server to use web search tool via SERP API
- Begin development of data chunking system for web retrieval

### Resources or Assistance Needed
