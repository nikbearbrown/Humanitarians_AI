# Bi-Weekly Update: Feb 15 - Feb 28, 2025

### Summary of Work Completed
- Developed configuration import module for replicating base agents
- Created comprehensive test suite for all simulation engine components
- Designed and implemented feedback analysis structure from critic agent
- Added custom inference LLM selection capability to the system
- Integrated knowledge base RAG with real-life test prompts
- Conducted successful project demonstration to stakeholders

### Tasks and Hours Breakdown
| Task | Hours |
|------|-------|
| Development of configuration import module | 14 |
| Test suite creation for simulation engine | 18 |
| Feedback analysis output structure implementation | 12 |
| Custom inference LLM selection development | 12 |
| Knowledge base RAG integration | 12 |
| Testing with real-life prompts | 8 |
| Project demonstration preparation and delivery | 4 |
| Team meetings and progress updates | 4 |
| **Total Hours** | **80** |

### Challenges Encountered
- Integration of different LLM backends required additional adapter patterns
- Performance bottlenecks in RAG implementation when using large knowledge bases
- Solutions: Created a standardized interface for LLM backends and implemented chunking and indexing optimizations for the knowledge base

### Goals for Next Two Weeks
- Research and plan new project development: SuperAgent Solution Merger
- Create system design document with high-level architecture
- Develop detailed design documentation including architecture diagrams
- Define project structure, design details, and technology stack
- Begin MVP development for solution merger

### Resources or Assistance Needed
- Access to previous SuperAgent project documentation
- Benchmarking tools for solution performance testing
- Feedback on proposed architecture from systems team
