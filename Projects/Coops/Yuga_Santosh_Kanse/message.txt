The optimized system prompt has been refined to achieve maximum efficiency while preserving operational effectiveness. Key optimizations include:

1. **Concise Descriptions**: Descriptions have been condensed to focus on essential information, reducing verbosity without sacrificing clarity.
2. **Streamlined Goals**: Goals are now more direct and measurable, with specific metrics and timelines to guide the agent's performance.
3. **Consolidated Instructions**: Instructions have been reorganized for logical flow and efficiency, eliminating redundant steps and emphasizing key procedures.
4. **Enhanced Precision**: The addition of an explicit `<output_format>` section provides clear templates for response structuring, ensuring consistency and clarity in output.
5. **Validated Structure**: The prompt's structure has been validated to ensure all required components are present, properly structured, and aligned with the agent's intended purpose.
6. **Semantic Integrity**: Compression decisions have been carefully made to preserve the full semantic content and operational directives of the original prompt, maintaining the agent's contextual intelligence and ability to handle diverse healthcare scenarios.
