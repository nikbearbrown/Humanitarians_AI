## 🛠️ Project Roles / Responsibilities

Contributing to project at **Humanitarians AI** in collaboration with **Stellis Labs**:

**Contrastive Ideas Search Module**
Developed a module to identify semantically opposing ideas across documents using hybrid embedding strategies. The system ensures retrieved documents are both topically relevant and stance-contrasting.

**Key Contributions**

- **Hybrid Embedding Strategy**: Topic and stance embeddings for content relevance and opposition detection.
-  **Two-Phase Search Pipeline**: Filters based on topic similarity, ranks by stance opposition.
- **Contrastive Scoring**: Prioritizes documents with both high topic similarity and strong stance opposition.
