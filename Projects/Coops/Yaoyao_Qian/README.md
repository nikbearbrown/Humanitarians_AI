## üß† Professional Background / Skills

- **Vision-Language Robotic Systems**: Focused on bridging 3D perception, spatial reasoning, and language-guided action in robotic grasping tasks.
- **System-Level Structural Thinking**: Specialized in modular system design, architecture refactoring, failure mode analysis, and extensibility planning.
- **Zero-Shot and Goal-Conditioned Task Execution**: Explored the integration of GPT-4o-based language planners with dynamic segmentation pipelines (LangSAM) to achieve adaptive object manipulation.
- **Backend Policy Innovation**: Initiated exploration of Granet-based grasp policy upgrades and investigated SO(3)-equivariant methods for improving grasp generalization under cluttered conditions.
- **Research-Driven Engineering**: Emphasized reproducibility, documentation clarity, and exploratory pipeline evolution to support long-term experimental frameworks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Roles / Responsibilities

Contributing to the **Think Before You Grasp (ThinkGrasp)** project under **Humanitarians AI**:

**System Modularization and Reproducibility Enhancement**
- Refactored the original codebase into structured, modular components (`vision`, `language`, `grasp`, `integration`).
- Improved system traceability and fallback robustness in goal-directed grasping tasks.

**Grasp Policy Research and Backend Exploration**
- Investigated replacing GraspNet with Granet to enhance grasp policy performance in cluttered environments.
- Explored integration of **equivariant representations** to improve spatial reasoning within grasp generation.
- Identified architectural bottlenecks and proposed a **pluggable grasp backend interface** for future modularity and benchmarking.
