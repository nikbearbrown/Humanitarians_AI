# Final Project Report: AI Textbook Development at Humanitarians AI
**January 6 - May 31, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This report details my contributions as an AI Agentic Engineer during a five-month Co-op with Humanitarians AI, from January 6 to May 31, 2025. My work focused on developing scalable AI textbook infrastructure, emphasizing automation, advanced querying, and user-friendly chat interfaces. Key projects included:

- **Textbook-Engine MVP**: Built an initial automation pipeline for AI textbook generation using Fumadocs, with scripts for content structuring and a chatbot interface.
- **Ask AI Feature Iterations**: Researched Oramaâ€™s chatbot capabilities, integrated OpenWebUIâ€™s textbook upload and chat feature with login-based memory for customized responses, developed a custom RAG-based Ask AI feature (facing scalability issues), and implemented a generative AI textbook with OpenWebUI for demos.
- **OpenStax Physics Volume 1 Conversion**: Converted OpenStax Physics Volume 1 into an AI textbook format, integrating Oramaâ€™s chatbot with a sync script for content indexing, with manual corrections for missing examples and chapter review problems.
- **Additional Textbooks**: Supported setup for textbooks like ENGR-0201, INFO-6205, and others.

The Textbook-Engine MVP provided the automation foundation, while OpenWebUIâ€™s chat feature, enhanced by a login-based memory system, and Oramaâ€™s chatbot with sync script enabled dynamic user interactions. OpenWebUI drove successful product demos, and Orama enhanced OpenStax querying. Scalability concerns led to prioritizing open-source solutions like OpenWebUI and Orama over earlier ChromaDB/Pinecone experiments. AWS Amplify optimized builds for large content volumes. My contributions delivered robust AI textbook solutions, supported by comprehensive documentation.

## Project Contributions

### Textbook-Engine MVP
- Developed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Textbook-Engine, automating AI textbook generation using Fumadocs.
- Implemented scripts including `setup.py` (project initialization), `config.py` (Tailwind CSS and page configuration), `generate_toc.py` (Table of Contents generation), `generate_sections.py` (section expansion), `generate_pagecontent_titles.py` (content titles), `generate_folder_structure.py` (docs structure), `generate_content.py` (MDX content), `generate_firstpage.py` (index page), `enhance_content.py` (content refinement), `document_indexer.py` (initial indexing experiments), `chromadb_explorer.py` (embedding exploration), and `doc_chatbot.py` (AI chatbot using Groqâ€™s Llama3).
- Tested the MVP pipeline, ensuring MDX compatibility and interactive user feedback for content refinement, with early indexing experiments using ChromaDB/Pinecone (later scrapped for scalability).
- **Outcome**: Established a foundational automation pipeline, enabling structured content generation and initial chatbot-based querying.

### Ask AI Feature Iterations
- **Orama Research**: Explored Oramaâ€™s chatbot for context-aware Q&A, evaluating its built-in indexing and retrieval capabilities with a sync script for textbook content. Avoided Inkeep due to its paid model, prioritizing open-source solutions.
- **OpenWebUI Integration**: Leveraged OpenWebUIâ€™s built-in textbook upload and chat feature, using backend calls to enable querying, with a login-based memory system for customized user responses.
- **Custom Ask AI Feature**: Developed a FastAPI-based backend with a custom RAG system, but scalability issues with large datasets led to its deprioritization.
- **Generative AI Textbook with OpenWebUI**: Built the ENGR-0201 generative AI textbook using OpenWebUIâ€™s chat feature and memory system to address scalability, enabling interactive content generation and product demos that received positive stakeholder feedback.
- **Outcome**: Delivered a scalable Ask AI solution through OpenWebUIâ€™s memory-enhanced chat, with Orama research guiding OpenStax integration, overcoming custom RAG limitations.

### OpenStax Physics Volume 1 Conversion
- Extended the Textbook-Engine MVP to convert OpenStax Physics Volume 1 into an AI textbook format, using automation scripts for MDX structuring. The pipeline produced formatting errors, content inaccuracies, and missing content, particularly examples and chapter review problems, requiring extensive manual corrections.
- Integrated Oramaâ€™s chatbot, using a sync script to index textbook content for dynamic, context-aware querying, validated for educational accuracy.
- Used AWS Amplify to optimize build performance, addressing high RAM usage during processing of large content volumes.
- Manually validated mathematical expressions, figures, examples, and chapter review problems to ensure alignment with educational standards.
- **Outcome**: Delivered a functional AI-formatted Physics textbook with Oramaâ€™s chatbot, despite pipeline challenges, ready for educational use.
