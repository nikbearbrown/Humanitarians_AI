# Pokemon Arena Experiment: Evaluating LLM-Based AI Agents in Strategic Multi-Agent Battles

## Overview

The Pokemon Arena Experiment is a cutting-edge research framework designed to evaluate the strategic decision-making capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-based AI agents in complex, multi-layered competitive environments. By simulating Pokemon battles with dynamic terrain effects and hierarchical decision-making, this experiment provides unprecedented insights into how AI systems handle uncertainty, adapt to changing conditions, and develop long-term strategies.

Unlike traditional AI benchmarks that focus on single-task performance, this experiment tests real-world applicable skills including hierarchical planning, risk assessment under incomplete information, and real-time strategic adaptation. The framework has direct applications to business strategy, military planning, crisis management, and other domains requiring sophisticated decision-making under uncertainty.

## Key Features

### Multi-Layered Strategic Decision Making
- **Roster Selection**: Long-term resource allocation from a pool of 50 non-legendary Pokemon
- **Team Composition**: Medium-term tactical planning without opponent information
- **Real-Time Combat**: Immediate decision-making with move selection and Pokemon switching

### Dynamic Environmental Factors
- Seven distinct terrain types (Water, Fire, Electric, Grass, Psychic, Rock, Normal)
- Terrain-specific move effectiveness modifiers
- Real-time adaptation requirements

### Comprehensive Scoring System
- Win-based scoring (10 points per battle victory)
- Performance metrics (2 points per knockout)
- Strategic efficiency evaluation (up to 5 points)
- Adaptability assessment (up to 3 points)
- Resilience tracking (up to 2 points)

### Tournament Structure
- Single-elimination format with 8 AI agents
- Best-of-five battle series
- Multiple tournament runs for statistical robustness
- Detailed battle logging and analysis

## Technical Architecture

- Heuristic-based decision making for routine choices
- Configurable rate limits to prevent API exhaustion

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Groq API key
- Internet connection for Pokemon data fetching

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pokemon-arena-experiment.git
cd pokemon-arena-experiment
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install groq requests beautifulsoup4 pandas numpy
```

3. Run the experiment:
```bash
python pokemon_arena.py
```

4. Enter your Groq API key when prompted (input will be hidden for security)

## Configuration

Modify these parameters in the `main()` function to customize your experiment:

```python
NUM_AGENTS = 2      # Number of AI agents in tournament
NUM_POKEMON = 30    # Size of available Pokemon pool
ROSTER_SIZE = 10    # Pokemon per agent roster
TEAM_SIZE = 3       # Pokemon per battle team
BEST_OF = 5         # Battles per match series
```

## Output Format

The experiment generates detailed, narrative-style battle logs:

```
Semifinal Match: Agent A vs. Agent B
Roster (Agent A): Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Pidgey, Pikachu, Geodude, Charmander, Diglett, Jigglypuff, Ekans, Vulpix.
Roster (Agent B): Charmeleon, Rhydon, Gyarados, Oddish, Machop, Spearow, Psyduck, Sandshrew, Growlithe, Bellsprout.

Battle 3 (Electric Terrain):
Turn 1: Agent A leads with Pikachu; Agent B chooses Gyarados.
Turn 1: Pikachu uses Thunderbolt (Electric, boosted by terrain, super effective vs. Water-type Gyarados). Gyarados takes heavy damage...
```

## Research Applications

### Business Strategy and Market Competition
Simulate competitive market dynamics where AI agents represent firms making portfolio decisions, pricing strategies, and marketing adaptations in response to market conditions.

### Military and Defense Planning
Model resource allocation, tactical decisions, and strategic planning under uncertain battlefield conditions with incomplete intelligence.

### Crisis Management
Test AI coordination of emergency responses, resource distribution, and priority adaptation during evolving disaster scenarios.

### Financial Portfolio Management
Evaluate investment strategies, risk assessment, and portfolio rebalancing in response to market volatility and economic indicators.

### Game AI Development
Train sophisticated AI agents for complex multiplayer games requiring long-term strategy and real-time tactical decisions.

## Key Insights from Research

### Hierarchical Planning Excellence
Successful agents demonstrate the ability to align long-term roster diversity with short-term combat decisions, mirroring real-world strategic planning where high-level strategy must integrate with operational execution.

### Risk Assessment Under Uncertainty
The blind team selection phase reveals both strengths and limitations in LLM probabilistic reasoning, highlighting areas for improvement in predictive modeling capabilities.

### Adaptive Strategy Development
Top-performing agents consistently exploit terrain advantages while mitigating disadvantages, demonstrating rule-based adaptation capabilities with room for improvement in novel scenario handling.

### Strategic Depth and Game Theory
The experiment reveals LLM potential for game-theoretic reasoning, with winning agents approximating Nash equilibrium strategies through opponent modeling and balanced risk profiles.

## Performance Metrics

The experiment tracks multiple performance indicators:

- **Decision Accuracy**: Percentage of type-effective and terrain-optimal moves
- **Adaptation Rate**: Frequency of strategy shifts in response to environmental changes
- **Risk Profiles**: Balance between high-risk/high-reward and conservative strategies
- **Resource Management**: Efficiency in Pokemon health and move usage
- **Opponent Modeling**: Accuracy in predicting and countering opponent strategies

## Future Development

### Planned Enhancements
- Expanded roster sizes for increased complexity
- Team-based battle modes with collaborative AI agents
- Real-time learning and strategy evolution
- Multi-agent alliance dynamics
- Advanced opponent modeling with deception detection

### Research Extensions
