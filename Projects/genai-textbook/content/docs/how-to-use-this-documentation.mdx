Welcome to the **Mastering AI and Generative AI Tools for Everyday Productivity** documentation! Here’s how to navigate the content effectively and get the most out of your learning experience:

## 1. Explore the Sidebar

On the left, you’ll see a sidebar (powered by Fumadocs) listing the **sections** and **subsections** of this course. Each section represents a major topic—like Prompt Engineering, Productivity Tools, or Creative Outputs. Clicking on any section reveals its subsections or pages, where you’ll find more detailed information.

**Tip:** If you see a small arrow next to a section title, click it to expand or collapse the subsections.

## 2. Read Front Matter for Context

At the top of each page, you’ll find **front matter** that provides:
- **Title**: Summarizes the page’s focus.  
- **Description**: Offers a quick overview of what you’ll learn.

Use this to quickly decide if the page covers the content you need.

## 3. Follow Step-by-Step Instructions

Many pages include **step-by-step guides**, **code snippets**, or **practical examples**. These are designed to help you:
- **Apply** AI tools to real-world tasks  
- **Practice** prompt engineering  
- **Experiment** with creative AI outputs

Feel free to follow along in your own development environment, or simply review the examples to deepen your understanding.

## 4. Use Search and Filters

Fumadocs typically provides a **search bar** or **filters** (depending on your setup) to help you find pages by keywords. If you’re looking for something specific—like “custom GPTs” or “multimodal LLMs”—try searching directly to jump to relevant pages.

## 5. Check Out the Hands-On Projects

The course includes **practical projects** where you’ll build AI assistants, generate creative portfolios, automate business workflows, and more. These pages offer:
- **Detailed instructions** on setup and execution  
- **Best practices** for AI tool integration  
- **Tips** on troubleshooting and optimization

Working through these projects is one of the best ways to solidify your learning.

## 6. Look for Additional Resources

Each major section may include **external resources** or **further reading**. We recommend exploring these links if you want deeper dives, alternative tools, or academic references to expand your knowledge.

## 7. Provide Feedback and Ask Questions

If you have questions or suggestions:
- **Leave feedback** in the Q&A or Feedback Session page at the end of the course.  
- **Reach out** on any discussion channels your organization or community may offer.

Your input helps us refine the course for future learners.
