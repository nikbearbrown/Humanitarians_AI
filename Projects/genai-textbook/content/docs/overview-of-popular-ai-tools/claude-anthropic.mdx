### Workflow Details

| Stage                     | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Comprehension Layer**   | Analyzes the user's input for intent and context.                          |
| **Ethical Guidelines Filter** | Ensures responses adhere to Anthropic's ethical principles.              |
| **Model Processing**      | Processes input using advanced machine learning techniques.                |
| **Response Generation**   | Creates a coherent and contextually appropriate reply.                     |
| **Output to User**        | Delivers the final response to the user.                                   |

## Example Code and Output

Claude is an excellent assistant for structured problem-solving and brainstorming. Here's an example:

### Python Code Example
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        sequence.append(sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2])
    return sequence

# Example usage
print(f"Fibonacci sequence (10 terms): {fibonacci(10)}")
```

### Output
```
Fibonacci sequence (10 terms): [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

Claude can provide explanations for this code, such as detailing how the loop generates the Fibonacci sequence iteratively.
