## How ChatGPT Works

The ChatGPT system processes input text through the following pipeline:

```mermaid
graph LR
A[User Input] --> B[Tokenization]
B --> C[Model Processing]
C --> D[Response Generation]
D --> E[Final Output]
```

### Breakdown of Each Stage

| Stage               | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tokenization**    | Converts user input into smaller units (tokens) for easier processing.     |
| **Model Processing**| Processes tokens using GPT architecture to understand intent and context. |
| **Response Generation** | Generates a response based on patterns and probabilities learned during training. |
| **Final Output**    | Converts the generated response tokens back into text for the user.       |

## Example Code and Output

ChatGPT can assist developers by generating and explaining code. Below is an example:

### Python Code Example
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Example usage
print(f"Factorial of 5: {factorial(5)}")
```

### Output
```
Factorial of 5: 120
```

ChatGPT can also explain how the recursion works in this function, breaking it down step-by-step for beginners.
