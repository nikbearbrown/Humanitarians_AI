## Example Code and Output

### Python Integration Example
```python
import grok_sdk

# Initialize Grok client
client = grok_sdk.Client(api_key="your_api_key")

# Example query: Analyze sales data
response = client.analyze_data(
    dataset="sales_data.csv",
    analysis_type="trend_analysis"
)

# Display results
print("Sales Trends:", response["trends"])
```

### Output
```
Sales Trends: {
    "2022-Q1": "10% growth",
    "2022-Q2": "15% growth",
    "2022-Q3": "5% decline",
    "2022-Q4": "20% growth"
}
```

This example demonstrates how Grok’s SDK can be used to quickly analyze datasets and extract meaningful insights.
