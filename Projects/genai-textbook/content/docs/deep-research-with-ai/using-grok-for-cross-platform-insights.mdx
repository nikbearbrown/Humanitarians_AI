    console.log(data);
})();
```

### Output
```json
[
  {
    "platform": "Twitter",
    "author": "@ai_researcher",
    "text": "AI is transforming the future of technology!",
    "sentiment": "positive"
  },
  {
    "platform": "Twitter",
    "author": "@tech_guru",
    "text": "AI poses ethical challenges for society.",
