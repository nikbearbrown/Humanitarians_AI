### Best Practices for Building Chatbots and Visualizing Non-Profit Data

## Abstract

Chatbots have become increasingly prevalent across various sectors, including healthcare, education, customer service, and non-profits, providing immediate, automated responses that enhance user experience and accessibility. This survey reviews the literature on best practices for designing chatbots, focusing on mental healthcare, ethical AI design, higher education, and open-domain applications. Additionally, the paper explores effective data visualization techniques for non-profits, emphasizing cultural sensitivity, usability, and user comprehension.

In mental healthcare, user-centered design is highlighted through the iHelpr chatbot, which provides self-assessment and well-being guidance. Ethical design principles, such as transparency and accountability, are essential for mitigating biases and maintaining user trust in AI systems. For higher education, a conceptual architecture is developed to streamline educational processes and support stakeholders. Challenges in open-domain chatbots are addressed by improving dialogue quality and employing large-scale models and appropriate training data.

Effective data visualizations are crucial for conveying complex information in an accessible manner. Best practices include culturally sensitive designs that minimize bias, usability studies to address visual literacy and data analysis complexities, and simple yet effective methods like pictographs and bar charts in health contexts. Enhancing human comprehension through improved saliency models is also discussed.

This survey contributes to Bear Brown and Co.'s commitment to sharing, open source, and promoting ethical AI by providing a comprehensive overview of best practices in chatbot design and data visualization. The insights gathered aim to inform and guide future developments in these fields, ensuring tools that are both effective and ethically sound.

## Introduction

Chatbots have seen widespread adoption across various sectors, including healthcare, education, customer service, and non-profits, due to their ability to provide immediate, automated responses that enhance user experience and accessibility. This paper surveys the literature on best practices for designing chatbots and effective data visualization techniques for non-profits, with a focus on user-centered design, ethical AI, educational applications, and open-domain challenges. It aims to provide comprehensive insights into developing and implementing chatbots and data visualizations that are both effective and ethically sound.

### Best Practices for Designing Chatbots

#### User-Centered Design in Mental Healthcare
The development of the iHelpr chatbot, as outlined by Cameron et al. (2018), exemplifies the importance of engaging users early in the design process. The chatbot administers self-assessment instruments and provides well-being guidance within a conversational interface, highlighting key features such as guided self-assessment on stress, anxiety, and depression. This approach ensures that the chatbot meets users' specific needs and preferences, enhancing its effectiveness in mental healthcare.

#### Ethical Design in AI Systems
Bang et al. (2021) discuss the necessity of adhering to ethical guidelines in AI systems to mitigate the negative effects of biased data and unethical conversations. The paper reviews general ethical principles, including transparency, explainability, accountability, fairness, privacy, and control. Emphasizing the importance of these principles helps prevent potential social losses and maintains user trust, ensuring that AI systems are responsible and trustworthy.

#### Design Knowledge for Higher Education
Sjöström et al. (2018) employ design science research to develop a conceptual architecture for chatbots in higher education. Their work highlights the importance of involving educational stakeholders throughout the development process, providing design recommendations based on a literature review and a proof-of-concept implementation. This approach ensures that chatbots effectively address the specific needs of students and faculty, enhancing learning and administrative efficiency.

#### Challenges in Open-Domain Chatbots
Roller et al. (2020) examine the complexities of building open-domain chatbots, focusing on large-scale models and appropriate training data. They discuss issues with generative models, such as producing dull and repetitive responses, and propose using unlikelihood loss to improve dialogue quality. Insights from human evaluations demonstrate that their models outperform existing approaches in multi-turn dialogues, addressing key challenges in developing more engaging and effective open-domain chatbots.

### Best Practices for Data Visualizations

#### Culturally Sensitive Data Visualizations
Gendron et al. (2016) emphasize the importance of understanding cultural differences when designing data visualizations for a global audience. By analyzing cultural traits and communication habits between Western and Eastern regions, the paper proposes best practices to minimize cultural bias and support timely, accurate decision-making. This approach is crucial for organizations competing in a global business environment, where cultural sensitivity can significantly impact the effectiveness of visual communications.

#### Usability in Data Visualizations
Mirel (1998) critically reviews usability concerns associated with data visualizations, highlighting limitations in the literature primarily authored by computing specialists. The paper calls for additional usability studies to address gaps from an object-oriented perspective, involving technical communicators with expertise in rhetoric and situated activities. This comprehensive approach aims to support users in sophisticated visual literacy and complex data analysis.

#### Data Visualization in Health Contexts
Melonçon and Warner (2017) discuss the need for an integrative literature review on data visualizations in health and medical contexts. Their findings suggest a lack of consensus on the best visualization methods for lay audiences. They identify effective practices such as pictographs, icon arrays, and bar charts, emphasizing simplicity. Further empirical studies are needed to improve the comprehension of complex health data among lay audiences.

#### Human Comprehension of Data Visualizations
Haass et al. (2016) address challenges in data visualization by comparing saliency models and emphasizing the need for new models to enhance visual search. They highlight that human visual processing involves both bottom-up and top-down attention processes, suggesting that more effective models can improve comprehension and decision-making. Their study establishes a performance baseline for assessing new data visualization saliency models.

The surveyed papers provide valuable insights into best practices for designing effective chatbots and data visualizations, focusing on user engagement, ethical considerations, cultural sensitivity, and usability. As these fields continue to evolve, ongoing research and interdisciplinary collaboration will be crucial to developing tools that are both informative and engaging for diverse audiences. This survey contributes to Bear Brown and Co.'s commitment to sharing, open source, and promoting ethical AI, guiding future developments in chatbot and data visualization design.
