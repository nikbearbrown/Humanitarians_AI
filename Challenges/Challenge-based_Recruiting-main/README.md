# Challenge-based recruiting

Challenge-based recruiting is a method where candidates are assessed based on their ability to complete tasks or challenges pertinent to the job role they're applying for. We highly recommend this approach for companies looking to hire the best people for a given job.

Every year, a staggering **6 billion resumes** flood companies across the globe. Behemoths like **Google**, **Walmart**, and **Apple** might grapple with a deluge of 60-70k resumes on a weekly basis. Given these astronomical figures, the notion that each resume undergoes meticulous scrutiny seems far-fetched. In the contemporary corporate arena, your historical accolades take a backseat. The burning query is: **What tangible contributions can you offer our organization now?** This is where challenge-based hiring emerges as a game-changer.

## How Does Challenge-Based Hiring Deviate from Traditional Methods?

Modern companies are not just filling vacancies; they're finding the best people. This foresight sets them on a trajectory distinct from the rest. Traditional hiring, characterized by a laundry list of job responsibilities, is metamorphosing. Under the challenge-based hiring model, candidates are confronted with a pressing, real-world conundrum pertinent to the role. This democratizes the selection process. Irrespective of one's academic pedigree, professional history, or network of influence, each contender has an equal shot to manifest their problem-solving prowess. What's the payoff for employers? They gauge candidates on the promise they exhibit, not the laurels they've accumulated.


### Key Aspects and Advantages

1. **Relevance to Job Role**: 
    - Challenges simulate tasks or situations a candidate might face on the job. For example, a software development role might entail fixing a bug or building a mini-application.
   
2. **Objective Assessment**:
    - Direct observation of how candidates handle job-related tasks.

3. **Potential Over Pedigree**:
    - Emphasizes actual capabilities over educational background or job titles.

4. **Reduced Bias**:
    - Evaluating tangible results can lead to a reduction in unconscious biases present in traditional methods.

5. **Engagement**:
    - An engaging way for candidates to showcase their skills.

6. **Realistic Job Preview**:
    - Sets clearer job expectations for candidates.

### Downsides or Challenges

1. **Time-Intensive**:
    - Designing, administering, and evaluating challenges can be time-consuming.

2. **Potential for Stress**:
    - Some might find this format intimidating or stressful.

3. **Narrow Assessment**:
    - Might miss out on aspects like cultural fit or interpersonal skills.

4. **Inequality**:
    - If not designed carefully, it might inadvertently favor certain candidates.
