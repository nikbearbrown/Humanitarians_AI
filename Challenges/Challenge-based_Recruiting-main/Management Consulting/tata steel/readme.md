## Steel industry
The steel industry is a critical industry in the world, and demand for its goods are often used as proxy for economic/ infrastructure development in the developing world and as proxy for business expansion in the developed world. Steel is commonly used in buildings (rebar), bridges (girders), tools, ships, trains, cars, bicycles, machines, electrical appliances, etc. 
The world produces over 1885 MT of steel annually. China dominates the market, producing 1018 MT with India second in the race at 154.06 MT.
Manufacturing steel requires the use of raw materials such as iron ore, limestone and coke and is carried out in a blast furnace. Exhibit 1 illustrates the modern manufacturing process.

The manufacturing of steel, although greatly improved in recent decades, still produces a lot of Greenhouse gas emissions. There has been increased scrutiny and intervention in the form of regulations and market focus on ESG metrics.
The industry has been previously flooded with low-cost foreign imports, prompting the government to introduce high tariff barriers and provide production linked incentive schemes ($3.5 billion) for encouraging domestic production.

## Tata Steel
Tata steel is a major player in the private steel sector industry of India. The company has a listed capacity of 35MT as of 2023 with 21MT in india and the rest spread across Europe, UK and Thailand. The firm is planning to double its india manufacturing to 40MT by 2030. The firm has a strong processing and distributing presence in india and is in various customer segments in B2C,B2G,B2B,OEM. The plant in Thailand has a manufacturing capacity of 1.7 MT and only operates in the B2C segment and handles primarily recycled steel parts.

The firm is unique in the fact that all its raw materials are provided by captive mines, giving some control over fluctuations in the raw materials markets.

## Competition and Challenges
The plant in the UK is rapidly aging and is fast approaching the end of its useful life, resulting in greater cost escalations, priority spending in capex and large losses. The firm employs over 8000 workers in Port Talbot in south wales. There is an ongoing negotiation with the UK government on a financial lifeline, leaving the division’s future uncertain. Exhibit 3 shows the profit and loss for UK.

The protracted conflict in Europe, and the diminished economy output in China (worlds largest consumer of steel) has significantly reduced the demand and price of steel across the globe. Additionally, the focus on decarbonization is expected to lead to a shift in the type of steel manufactured.

## Questions to answer
1.	**What can be the steps taken to improve the unstable EBITDA margin?**
2.	**Should the company continue to find new markets or prioritize improving in its home market?**
3.	**What is a reasonable valuation of the firm?**

## Answers
1. **EBITDA**
  - The EBITDA margins from 2023 to 2019 are:
20.03%, 38.42%, 31.29%, 22.34%, 30.36%
These are caused by a steady increase in other expenses. The company should find ways to reduce the same.
2. **Find new markets or prioritize home market**
 - Since Tata steel primarily manufactures domestically (60%) it may be better off for TATA steel to focus on the home market. Tata steel can consider downsizing or spinning off the unprofitable foreign division.
3. **Reasonable valuation of the firm**
  - The enterprise value of the firm can be determined by:
  MC + Debt – Cash
  = 132 * 12,218,901,999 + 98,993.91 - 1077.33
  =  Re 1,612,895 Million
