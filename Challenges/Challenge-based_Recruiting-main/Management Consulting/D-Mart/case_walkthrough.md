**Interviewer**: Prompt: Our client is D-Mart a hypermarket chain which operates only in india and has a revenue of RE 270.14 billion. As the corona virus has just hit and lockdowns are announced the client, which has never had an online presence before, wants to enter the field to survive and avoid disruption/losses. They also want to navigate the ecommerce space and maintain their competitive edge.  


**Candidate**: That’s really great. Id like to ask some clarifying questions. Why do you want to go online? How would success be evaluated, are there any metrics for performance, market share that the firm would like to hit? Are there any other objectives or constraints I need to be aware of?  

**Interviewer**: Our main aim is survival; we are forecasting massive losses as our customers will be locked indoors and unable to walk to our stores. We hope to not lose any revenue in the process and would ideally like to transition all losses from in store to online to maintain the same revenue as of 2019 RE 270.14 billion.  We have the second largest market share amongst physical hypermarkets in the country, we want to maintain our market share as well as achieve the same market position with our new e-commerce division. As the pandemic is really fast acting, we really need this to happen in one year.

**Candidate**: Can I assume that you primarily operate in the B2C and sell only to clients and not to other businesses like restaurants, kiranas etc.? Also how will this incentive be funded, and are you flexible on the budget?  

**Interviewer**: Yes we have a negligible presence in the B2B sector and most of our sales are in the B2C which we want to preserve. We have a liquid cash reserve of Re 150 Million, for ensuring an effective online establishment. We do not want to commit any further resources to this unless we must.  

**Candidate**: Have you performed any research? What is your current presence online?  

**Interviewer**: Yes we have done some research, gathered data about online market size and our competitors. We have also conducted an in-store survey with our customers to see if they would like to buy online. We have a simple website which showcases our awards and contains contact information for suppliers to reach us. We don’t have any ecommerce presence.

Customer who shop online at least once per

|  Customer category | Weekly | Monthly | Never |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
|  Single Men | 70% | 25%  | 5% | 
|  Single Women | 60% | 20%  | 10% | 
|  Families without children | 20% | 30%  | 50% | 
|  Families with one or more children| 15% | 40%  | 45% | 

**Candidate**: Id like to ask one last clarifying question; do you plan to have an online presence throughout india or only in the regions where you have a physical presence?  

**Interviewer**: We would like to do pan india if its profitable and within budget, otherwise we are fine with our traditional regions of coverage.  

**Candidate**: That’s great. To summarize thus far, you are seeking to establish a strong e commerce business primarily to preserve revenue, you also have a stretch objective to mirror your physical market share in the digital market place . You need to obtain this within a year. You need to start ground up for your digital store, and you would like to sell across india if possible. You need to achieve all this with a budget of Re 150 M.  

**Interviewer**: Correct. What’s next?  

**Candidate**: The restrictions imposed by the government require social distancing and prohibits all but non-essential movement , as you sell essential items you are allowed to operate though with reduced capacity. However the online ecommerce sector is really booming and is expected to hit $100 billion by this year end. Online customers tend to spend 20% more than in person, according to consumer surveys, so its really good to help you get online.  

**Candidate**: Id like to discuss the loss projection and more about your customers. Your estimates show that you expect to lose around 18 million customers and revenue per customer will dip by around 17%.  
 Its also clear that married couples tend to shop online fewer, especially if they have children. My guess is that single customers are more tech savvy and the couples may be of an older generation and more unfamiliar with the technology. Can you tell me more about your breakdown by customer group to overall revenue and more about what customers really value from the brand?  


|  Customer category | Breakdown by customer profile | Breakdown by revuene |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
|  Single Men | 5% | 5%  | 
|  Single Women | 15% | 15%  | 
|  Families without children | 30% | 30%  | 
|  Families with one or more children| 50% | 50%  |

**Interviewer**: Yes, a majority of our customers are families and are unfamiliar with technology. Our customers really value the low prices and freshness of our products, they enjoy the quality that our competitors can’t deliver.  

**Candidate**: That’s really great, we should make sure that we deliver the same quality when we go online. What is your current supply and logistics chain? Which parts of the country do you have presence in?  

**Interviewer**: We have a strong presence in 14 states of india but are primarily concentrated in the state of Maharashtra, that’s also where most of our revenue is from. We have a strong network of suppliers from which we procure items on a daily basis and send it directly to our 320 stores.  

**Candidate**: So you do not have any warehouses to stock goods?  

**Interviewer**: No, we have a lean and quick operation to keep costs low. Warehouses are unnecessary.  

**Candidate**: That’s great! I think I have enough to provide a plan of action, first id like to talk about the ecommerce transition and then the revenue portion.  

**Candidate**: About the online portion, I would suggest you create a website and a mobile application on both android and IOS. As you need to really move fast, I would suggest Agile methodology for development. 
As you have data for the products that are sold, you could use machine learning to identify the most sold items and select them for your online product space. 
You have 2 primary options to set up an ecommerce business, either you can hire third party contractors to collect and deliver goods from the store on behalf of customers, or you can rent real estate or convert one of your physical stores into a warehouse to deliver goods directly to customers more efficiently.
I would recommend the second approach as it gives more control over the quality the customer receives and also allows you to use idle store space/ employees that would be wasted. Also you can consider attaching loyalty rewards, and free return policies to attract and retain customers. This should be possible with your budget. However, obtaining the same market share in the digital space is not possible in just a year, it will take significantly longer to achieve the same as there are well established players in the space.  

**Candidate**: From the revenue side, unfortunately I don’t think you can hit your targets. Based on the estimates only 61% of the displaced customers are likely to go online. Even with the increased spend of 1.2x you are not likely to hit the revenue of 2019 – 2020. However following my recommendations, you can establish a strong position in the online ecommerce market on a sustainable long term basis.
