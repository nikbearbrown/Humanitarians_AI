# D-Mart Online Expansion case questions
The time is May 2020 at the onset of the COVID induced lockdowns in India. D-Mart, one of India's leading retail chains, has no online presence and its revenue from physical stores are starting to drop due to social distancing measures and restrictions imposed on sale of non-essential items. This case study explores the key issues faced by D-Mart and outlines a management consulting approach to establish an online ecommerce presence.

However, the corona virus epidemic has caused the following issues:
1.	Government Regulations: The government of India has placed regulations on how many customers can attend the store. As a result, the revenue earned has gone down drastically.
2.	Distribution Network: The current distribution network may not be optimized for online delivery, resulting in inefficiencies in delivering products to individual customers.

The primary objectives of this consulting engagement are:

1.	Design a viable stratergy to enable D-Mart to enter the indian ecommerce market
2.	Ensure the companies brand identity is maintained even when online 
3.	Identify areas of improvement within D-Mart's supply chain operations for online delivery
4.	Recommend technology solutions to enhance supply chain visibility and agility
5.	Provide a roadmap for implementing these recommendations to achieve measurable improvements in supply chain efficiency.

## Case Analysis:
Consultants will need to perform a comprehensive analysis of D-Mart, including:

1.	Demand Forecasting:  Analyze historical sales data to identify key products that are in high demand and can be delivered to the customer
2.	Market share and nature: Analyze the physical/digital retail sector in india and provide insights on client’s goals of maintaining or achieving market share
3.	Distribution Network: Assess the current distribution network for suitability with ecommerce model and propose suggestions to ensure smooth process for all stakeholders (D-Mart, Vendors, Customers)
4.	Technology Integration: Identify suitable supply chain management software and tools to enhance visibility and automation.

## Implementation Plan:
Consultants will create a detailed implementation plan outlining the steps, timelines, and responsible parties for each recommendation. The plan will also include performance metrics to measure the success of the initiatives.
