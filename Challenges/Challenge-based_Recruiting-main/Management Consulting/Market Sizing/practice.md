**Assumptions**:
US is a developed economy, with an aging population pyramid.
Children from the age of 5 drink coke, due to the high sugar content younger age groups are likely to drink coke more and more often. As people age they tend to become more health conscious and reduce their consumption of unhealthy drinks. Beyond 80+ years of age, coke will become too risky (diabetes, cholesterol or other ailments) to take on a reasonable basis hence nobody of the age group is consuming it.
Kids love to drink coke and will take it multiple times a day, young adults will order a lot of their meals and take coke 2 times. The others only take coke occasionally or once a day.
