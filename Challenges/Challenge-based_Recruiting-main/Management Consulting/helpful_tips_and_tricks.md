# General facts:
1.	Population of the USA is 331 million USD (2021)
2.	Number of households in the USA is 123 million (2020)
3.	Life expectancy is 80+
4.	Median age of American is 38 (2019)

*Common formulas*:
1.	Net income = Revenue – all expenses
2.	Breakeven point (no of units) = Fixed cost/(price per unit – variable cost)
3.	Breakeven price point = Fixed cost/ number of units + variable cost(per unit)
4.	Profit margin =  Net income / Revenue . (Note the income portion can vary if depending on the type, this is net income margin, gross is  (Revenue-Cogs)/Revenue
5.	Return on investment = Returns/Investment cost
6.	Compound annualized growth rate (%) = ((Final/Initial value) ^ (1/number of years) ) - 1

# Market Sizing:

## Population based questions
You are asked to estimate something based on population, i.e. how many cokes are drunk in the USA per day?
You can only ask clarifying questions, its best to write down your assumptions and share your thought process with the interviewer. The interviewer wants to see your approach and your ability to think and assume things logically. You should aim to nail the answer or get stuck, work creatively and transparently occasionally the interviewer will challenge your assumptions defend it if its reasonable otherwise accept the change if its logical.

*Steps*
1.	First make sure you understand what the product/ask is. If its coke, understand that’s it’s a sugary drink(soda) consumed on a recreational basis, often after a meal or just for fun.
2.	Logically breakdown population into segments or age groups. Write this down.
3.	Determine the number of people in each bracket who will use the product.
4.	Some people are more likely to be heavy users, moderate users or light users of the product. This will significantly change the demand for the product so track this separately
5.	Combine all the information to arrive at a figure. If its way off try to estimate a more suitable number and share with the interviewer why you think you got it wrong. This is why writing everything down is important

# Approach:
When presented with the problem you always want to ask about the firm and its objectives, and any constraints. 
You will need to find out more about the firm, the market, and industry before making any suggestion. This is not a static list as things change depending on the industry 
To get a strong understanding you should ask about:
## The company:
1.	The company’s revenue and profits:
a.	 Ask about revenue streams (Sale of services, interest income, rent dividends etc)Ask for a breakdown of each channel and its % contribution to the total
b.	Ask about the costs of the company and try to find out if they are reasonable.
2.	Customer Segmentation:
a.	Characteristics: Typical customer profile. Who buys their products or services and why?
b.	Changing needs: Can this customer segment evolve over time, ie the customer changes income level and no longer interested in the company products, or fast fashion which requires a lot of R&D and trend analysis, etc
c.	Profitability:  Find out about profitability of each customer segment. Which customers make the most money for the firm and why? 
3.	Product mix:
a.	Cost and margins: Find out the various products sold by the firm. Its important to ask the variable costs of each product and to know the fixed cost of the firm. These are Required useful for contribution or break even calculations. 
b.	Product differentiators: What makes each product different? Any recent changes to the mix?
c.	Market share: Find out how much of each product contributes to the companies revenue. For many companies often a handful of products account for the most sales or profits. Some cases it can be 20% of the products produce 80% of the profits
d.	Internalities and Externalities: Do the products cannibalize each other or their intended audiences are different?  Can the product have effects that hamper or hinder the goal? IE Mining Coal can lead to an increase in pollution.
4.	Production capabilities/capacity:  Is the firm manufacturing to its maximum potential, or is a lot of capacity idle?
5.	Brand/Market Structure: Does the company have a strong brand? Are they are a market leader or market participant
6.	Distribution channels: How does the company sell its products online,offline, international/local. Try to find out the % to the whole
7.	What would constitute success? How is success measured? Customer satiafaction growth in sales, etc?
8.	Structure of the firm, if they are publicly traded or private to ask about voting power or consensus to accept and implement the change

## Market:
Ask the questions about the market:
1.	Market size, growth and trends: What is the market size, is it growing or shrinking? Try to determine the addressable market. Is there any seasonality or trend that could impact a recommendation you make?
2.	Market life stage: Is it a new market, an established market or declining market? IE crypto or NFT is a new market. This is important to know as it would be more challenging to establish in a new market(brand identify, regulations,etc)  but can bring first mover or advantages
3.	Industry drivers: What drives the industry? IE Steel depends on construction.
4.	Customer segmentation: There are segments within the industry, consider construction : Retail, Industrial, Infrastructure, etc
5.	Margins: What is the typical margin by players in the industry
6.	Industry changes: Any major changes in the industry, any major relaxation of barriers or regulations, M&A? You can try to supplement this with porters 5 forces analysis
7.	Distribution channels:
8.	Major players and market share: Is the industry fragmented, or only few players have all the market share?
9.	Product differentiation: How does one product differentiate from the other?
10.	Access to suppliers: Are there many suppliers or just few? Ties into porters
11.	Barriers to entry exit

# Common case scenarios:
1.	Profit and Loss
2.	Enter a new market
3.	Pricing
4.	Growth and increasing sales
