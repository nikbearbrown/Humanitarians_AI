As a result, there has been a shift towards ML-based systems capable of handling more diverse and complex data inputs, improving diagnostic support in specific clinical domains such as radiology and oncology.

Research has shown promising results in using ML for diagnostic support, such as predicting malignancies from skin lesion photographs and diagnosing sight-threatening eye diseases from optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans. Additionally, ML is being explored for other decision support applications, including risk prediction for conditions like sepsis and personalized therapy recommendations. These systems aim to enhance clinical accuracy and tailor treatments to individual patients by learning from extensive datasets.

#### Quality and Safety in ML Systems

Despite the potential benefits, implementing ML in clinical settings poses significant quality and safety challenges:

1. **Distributional Shift**: ML systems can suffer from distributional shifts when there is a mismatch between training and operational data. This issue often arises due to biases in the training dataset or when applying the system to new, unanticipated patient contexts. Ensuring that ML systems can recognize and adapt to these shifts is crucial for maintaining clinical accuracy.

2. **Insensitivity to Impact**: ML systems must be trained not only to optimize for accuracy but also to consider the real-world impacts of their predictions. For instance, systems should err on the side of caution in high-risk scenarios to prevent missed diagnoses or over-diagnosis, aligning with clinical safety practices.

3. **Black Box Decision-Making**: Many ML algorithms, particularly those based on neural networks, operate as black boxes, making it difficult to interpret their predictions. This opacity can obscure errors and biases, necessitating the development of interpretability tools, such as saliency maps, to identify the most influential factors in predictions.

4. **Unsafe Failure Modes**: ML systems should incorporate mechanisms to estimate and communicate their confidence levels. When confidence is low, the system should fail safely by withholding a prediction rather than providing potentially erroneous guidance.

#### Comparative Analysis of Explainable ML Models for Hospital Mortality

Machine learning (ML) has significant potential to enhance clinical decision-making, particularly in predicting patient outcomes such as hospital mortality. However, the lack of explainability in ML models has hindered their acceptance in healthcare. To address this, Stenwig et al. (2020) utilized the eICU database to construct and compare several ML models for predicting hospital mortality, employing SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to interpret the models' predictions.

**Methods and Models**: The study involved developing four ML models—random forest, logistic regression, naive Bayes, and adaptive boosting—using features similar to those in the APACHE IV score. SHAP values were used to interpret the models, offering insights into how different features influence predictions.

**Results**: The models demonstrated similar discriminative abilities but varied in feature calibration and the impact of individual features. The random forest model exhibited the highest AUC, while the naive Bayes model had the lowest. SHAP value analysis revealed differences in how models weighed features, highlighting the importance of model explainability in clinical settings.

**Conclusions**: The study underscored the need for explainable ML models in healthcare. SHAP values provided a transparent method for understanding model behavior, potentially increasing trust and acceptance among clinicians. The findings suggest that explainable models can bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and clinical applicability, ensuring that ML tools align with medical knowledge and improve patient outcomes.

#### Discussion

**Calibration and Performance**: The calibration curves indicated that while all models had similar discriminative abilities, their predictions did not always align with actual outcomes. This misalignment emphasizes the need for continuous model evaluation and recalibration to maintain accuracy in clinical settings.

**Explainability with SHAP**: SHAP values offered a detailed view of how individual features influenced model predictions. This transparency is crucial for clinicians who must understand and trust ML models to integrate them into practice. By visualizing feature impacts, SHAP helps identify and rectify potential biases, ensuring models operate fairly and effectively.

**Limitations and Future Directions**: The study's models were based on specific datasets and features, which may limit their generalizability. Future research should explore more diverse datasets and advanced ML techniques to enhance model robustness and applicability. Additionally, integrating domain knowledge throughout the model development process can further improve the alignment between ML predictions and clinical reality.

#### Conclusion

The integration of AI and ML in healthcare offers transformative potential but also necessitates careful consideration of safety, bias, and ethical implications. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach involving clinicians, AI researchers, and regulatory bodies. By developing comprehensive frameworks and adhering to rigorous quality control standards, the medical community can harness the benefits of AI while mitigating risks, ultimately enhancing patient care and safety.
