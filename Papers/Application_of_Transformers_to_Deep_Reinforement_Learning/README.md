### 1. Introduction
Transformers have emerged as a dominant architecture in deep learning, primarily due to their ability to handle sequential data with long-range dependencies efficiently. The introduction of the Transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017) marked a paradigm shift in NLP, outperforming traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on various tasks. Since then, transformers have evolved significantly, with innovations such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), GPT (Radford et al., 2018), and Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). This paper explores the current trends and innovations in transformers, focusing on their expanding applications, architectural advancements, and practical implementations in real-world scenarios, including a comprehensive analysis of their role in deep reinforcement learning.

### 2. Architectural Innovations in Transformers
The transformer architecture has undergone numerous enhancements to address its limitations and improve performance. Some of the key innovations include:

#### 2.1. Efficient Transformers
One of the significant drawbacks of the original transformer model is its quadratic complexity concerning input sequence length, making it computationally expensive for long sequences. Recent research has introduced several efficient transformer variants to overcome these challenges, representing a crucial trend in making transformers more scalable and applicable to a broader range of problems:

- **Longformer** (Beltagy et al., 2020): Introduces a combination of global and local attention mechanisms to handle longer sequences efficiently, making it suitable for tasks such as document classification and summarization where long-range dependencies are critical.
- **Reformer** (Kitaev et al., 2020): Utilizes locality-sensitive hashing to reduce the time complexity of attention mechanisms, which is particularly advantageous for large-scale language modeling and machine translation tasks.
- **Linformer** (Wang et al., 2020): Reduces the attention complexity to linear time by projecting the attention matrix, allowing for efficient processing of long sequences and opening new opportunities in fields like genomics and protein folding studies.

These innovations reflect the trend towards optimizing transformers for efficiency and scalability, enabling their deployment in more computationally constrained environments and broader applications.

#### 2.2. Multimodal Transformers
Transformers have been adapted to handle multimodal inputs, integrating data from various sources such as text, images, and audio. This trend towards multimodal learning reflects the growing demand for models that can process and integrate diverse data types, which is crucial for applications in areas like autonomous systems and human-computer interaction:

- **VisualBERT** (Li et al., 2019): Integrates text and image data for visual question answering, demonstrating the versatility of transformers in understanding multimodal data.

Multimodal transformers represent a significant innovation trend, as they extend the capabilities of traditional transformer models beyond unimodal data processing, enabling more sophisticated AI systems that can reason across different modalities.

#### 2.3. Sparse and Adaptive Transformers
Sparse transformers introduce sparsity in the self-attention mechanism to reduce computational overhead without sacrificing performance. Adaptive transformers dynamically adjust the computation based on input data characteristics, optimizing resource usage, a crucial innovation for deploying transformers in real-time and resource-constrained environments.

- **Sparse Transformer** (Child et al., 2019): Reduces computation by limiting attention to a fixed subset of tokens, which is particularly useful in scenarios where not all parts of the input are equally important, such as in image or video processing.
- **Adaptive Attention Span Transformer** (Sukhbaatar et al., 2019): Adjusts the attention span for different layers or heads dynamically, improving the model's adaptability to different types of data sequences.

### 3. Applications Beyond Natural Language Processing
While transformers originated in NLP, their application has extended to various domains beyond text-based data, aligning with the current trend of applying deep learning techniques across multiple fields:
